Bought some great mooncakes for the Mid Autumn Fest and were reasonably priced. My 2 favs are their butter buns and steamed buns - best in Chinatown. Also they have a good selection of cakes, buns and cookies. You gotta try their custard cakes. There are like 8 or 9 bakeries in Chinatown. This one is at the top of my list."

My boyfriend claims his Budweiser didn't taste right and his salad had a slight brown tint to it and barely any green. He got a steak and broccoli. The steak was tiny and shitty, but the broccoli was perfecto. I got a half burnt salmon/ bacon wrap. Then I went to the bathroom and felt like I was peeing outside in the -4 degree weather. Went back to the table and waited for the waitress for bout 5 mins then took her the credit card. I explained to the manager how cold it is in the women's bathroom. He said, \" would you like me to bring in the fire pit from outside and light a fire for you?\" While laughing at his own joke another worker sitting next to him said, \" it's the same in the men's bathroom , my dick shrivels up every time I go in there.\" This place must be a drug front."

Despite this, its convenient so I keep going back. Today topped the cake. I sat there for 15 mins... Only for them to turn it off my little red button off in stall number 10 without ever taking my order. I am now at Krystals up the street trying to salvage what's left of my lunch break. I think I'm done trying here. Lol."

Nothing is more disappointing to me than going to a Vietnamese restaurant in the US snd order pho and it either has no flavor, to much grease, or the nasty after taste of msg. That is NOT the case here. The pho broth is so aromatic and many levels of flavor you want to drink the whole bowl.  That's not all! The egg rolls are so crispy and flavorful, easily can tell they are hand made and fresh.  Great food snd service, if they had a restaurant it would crush the others in Tampa Bay.  \nSomebody give these folks some recognition for their pho!!"

I saw they were in the nearby neighborhood today, & I immediately went online to order.\n\nSince it is a chilly winter night, I knew that Pho was perfect for me. I ordered the beef and meatball pho and it was a great amount of meat to noodle ratio. It was super tasty. \n\nI also ordered the bbq Pork banh mi. It had tons of flavor with it and the bread was a nice texture, not too hard and still nicely toasted.\n\nLastly, I ordered the Vietnamese wings with fries. The flavor is good for the wings and the fries were okay, they are the skinny ones. That was my husband's order.\n\nWhen I ordered it online I received an update through text of when it would be finished and I drove across the street to get it. So super simple and convenient. \n\nI'm super happy to have their leftovers tomorrow!! So so good.\n\nThanks for coming out to the area! So nice not to go far and leave the neighborhood!"

I had absolutely no issues with either service or food quality or the speed and accuracy of my Slam. I don't get to this Denny's often, but I rather enjoyed the causal ambiance.  Not exactly a diner, yet comfortable and fast. As for my breakfast, I made a slam of scrambled eggs, white toast, bacon and sausage. Every tasted very good. I really liked the thin, crispy bacon which was crunchy and not smoky. The thick ceramic mug really held the heat of the coffee which was served piping hot."

After I read my order, she asked if there'd be anything else, I said it would be all, then she hung up on me. Hmm.. weird, I thought. So I go in to pick up my order, which (my fault) I didn't double check, and come home to find multiple items missing. I call back to make sure I wasn't charged, since I didn't receive an itemized receipt, and the same lady answers. \"Okay well I didn't hear you,\" she says after I explained the situation, and hangs up on me...AGAIN. Thankfully I wasn't charged. So, I figure, she had a bad night, whatever. \n\nSo then last night, I decide to order takeout again. I recognize the woman's voice immediately, so I go ahead and place my order, once again she gives me the total, I say okay, she hangs up on me without reading back the order or telling me how long it'll be. So I call back asking how long it'll be, \"I don't know, 20 minutes?\" HANGS UP. At this point I'm wondering if I even go pick up the food, but I think to myself whatever, the Mac is good. So I go down to pick up my food, and a woman brings it out to me. Low and behold, it's the same woman that on the phone, AND she's the manager! I felt less crazy after reading the other reviews, it seems her attitude and knack for being unprofessional is a normal thing. Good pasta, doesn't make up for the bad service."

However it was obvious to me that the older female manager named Trena was terrible toward her employees and guests, I have never seen such terrible management! Although I thought it was a pleasant time due to our service, the management will never make me come back ever again! The gentlemen in the suit walks around like he owns the place aswell! Terrible!"

We didn't have this one planned out, rather looked at online reviews for nice Asian because we had already had so much heavy, fried cuisine.  This place was a gem!\n\nI called ahead for a reservation but they were booked up for most of the night.   I was told we could sit at the bar and it would be best to come early.   We actually arrived before their dinner hours began, so we sat at the bar and ordered from their small plates.  \n\nMike was very friendly, helpful, and welcoming.  He concocted a great non-alcoholic drink for me, which I ordered a few of over the course of our meal!   I can't remember exactly what it was, I believe it was made of cranberry juice, soda water, and a generous sprig of rosemary (picture attached).\n\nWe started with the edamame, yaki gyoza (pheasant dumplings), tuna tartare, and lobster shumai (lobster and corn dumplings).  Everything was nicely plated and tasted wonderful.\n\nNext up were the famed spicy crab noodles.  Upon arrival of this dish, we quickly realized: a) that it was so good that we had to order another, b) that it was so good that my spouse was going to eat it all so we had to order another, and c) that it was so good that I wasn't going to want to share the dish with my spouse, so we had to order another!  So, we immediately ordered another!   \n\nAlso--interesting find--the toilet seats were heated!  \n\nThis is a very unique establishment and we were glad to have the opportunity to visit it!   We were happy to find such a friendly place with fresh ingredients and very unique selections for our last big meal in Nashville!"

The restaurant was comfortable and interesting.  The food was outstanding.  Lobster shomai was so memorable.  The wagyu beef was perfectly cooked and presented and the spicy crab noodles were equally great.  We are from Atlanta so can't get back anytime soon but we will be there again at some point.  It's worth the trip!"

They have a drive thru so I don't have to get Covid. I feel like Kevin from Home Alone when I come here because I'm always getting a cheese pizza, but the cheesy bread dipped into some marinara is also dope. If you've seen my other posts, you know that the wife and daughter are GF, don't do this option here they can't comprehend cross contamination, and I don't expect the teenagers here to either, BDP!

It was a busy Friday night but the staff was friendly, our food came out quick and the fries were hot. \nFun place and great location. We'll definitely be back."

Firstly, I had no idea they offered an AYCE buffet brunch for $40 including wine, beer, and some specialty drinks. That's not a bad deal. I didn't opt for the buffet  brunch because I wasn't that hungry, \n\nI wound up getting the burger and fries combo which is always pretty good here. Mind you I just said I wasn't that hungry and barely finished my food. My wife ordered the sauteed mushroom melt and hers was so big, we could have split that instead. \n\nOverall, I will definitely just stick to Thursday mostly because as much as I love the kids play area, I could see my daughter was overwhelmed by the amount of kids and didn't have as much fun which is half the reason we come, but that's nothing the business can control. Thursdays seem to be a sweet spot, but that brunch will definitely be explored one day soon!"

The French onion soup... it had a piece of processed white cheese on top..... wtf!!!  I would expect this at McDonald's  or Taco Bell if they had it....   ok the kabob.  It was cold!!\nThe scallops way over cooked.  Honestly, I have never had exceptional service there. Always slow. And now that I have thought about it.  The owners need to spend more time there. My dinner tonight was pathetic. I am done with this place. Too many chances and too many let downs."

Needless to say he didn't eat the food. I told him to send the restaurant an E-mail which he did. He received no response. I then sent an E-mail. It's now 3 weeks after our purchase and we have heard nothing. Clearly they don't care about customer service so we will not be going back."

It comes with six chicken cutlets sitting on top of pasta, salad and bread for $60. \n\nIt's tasty and since it's intended to feed up to six people, we always get at least two dinners for the three of us, and usually one or two of us also get a lunch. \n\nMy only complaint is that it's apparently aimed at families where only one or two people (the adults?) actually want to eat salad. We can barely stretch it to three. \n\nIt's in the neighborhood and will definitely keep it in our takeout rotation."

The restaurant filled up quickly. We didn't order any appetizers. They did bring us a basket of warm, delicious bread and a small plate of beans in olive oil. Our meals came out quickly. We had veal parmigiana, fettuccine Alfredo, lasagna, and gnocchi. Everything was delicious. Our server was hustling around the whole time. There only seemed to be 3 servers for a large dining room. I would definitely recommend Core de Roma and would go there again."

The drinks here are great though. The chai latte I had was far better than the watered down junk I used to get at Starbucks and who would really expect a high quality drink from a place where the drinks are not the main focus? It was a great surprise!\n\nThe cat room is really cute and homey although admittedly a bit small. My friend and I were the only customers for the hour that we were there though and it was so nice being able to love on all the cats and not have to deal with a horde of other patrons attempting to get their attention. I think the staff love on them quite a bit as well. All the kitties we visited with seemed very well socialized and not at all skittish.\n\nAll in all it was an awesome time and I hope to visit and have many more here at Paws."

It is fried to your liking. The Jambalaya is cooked how the vendors at the French Quarter Fest and the Jazz Fest cooked theirs. It is so delicious to say your mom or uncle did not cook it. There is always a table available so you hardly have to wait. The to go orders are always hot and ready like Little Caesars. The managers are always on the floor greeting each customers. There is a special each day. The hours isn't early bird friendly, but it'll do if you ever want to meet a few friends and family there. Stop by and ask for Sydney, she is a great waitress."

I complained my Oyster Rockefeller tasted burned but received no reimbursement for my order. Thursday morning my husband and I had a severe case of food poisoning at which time I emailed the director of Lafittes Landing  (advising her of a possible bad batch of oysters served to us the previous evening)due to our food poisoning. I received a response of \"thanks,I will investigate\". I was never offered any compensation,apologized to or offered a complimentary meal/reimbursement for our previous meal. This is not the proper way to run a business."

Summary: go for the Thursday night 1/2 off scooner drink special, don't eat the food. \n\nThe beer special is decent with a fairly good selection. The beers are expensive straight up ($6-8), but you can drink a scooner of craft beer (32 oz) for $5. \n\nThis last visit I didn't eat my meal. I ordered the steak burger medium with chipotle salsa (I was experimenting). The steak burger was well done as was my friend who also ordered medium. The buns were the cheap, wonderbread, kind you get in the 12-pack for a block party bbq. The chipotle salsa appeared to just be some salsa from a common brand container. This all cost me $9, which was ridiculous. \n\nThe restaurant was pretty much empty, but I'm not that surprised. Come here for the drink special before it goes out of business!"

Soured by the fact that they wouldn't put the volume up on the game (at all!), our moods changed once receiving a spot on beer recommendation for my finicky beer drinking friend. Our meals arrived in a timely manner.  An Old Bay burger for my friend and the Grilled Seafood Cobb Salad for me.  What a pleasant surprise!  Aside from the very odd and unnecessary crumbled  blue cheese (which I nixed ), this was one of the best salads I've ever had.  The seafood was grilled and seasoned perfectly (scallops, shrimp and salmon) and a healthy portion of chilled crabmeat also made an appearance.   The greens were fresh and crisp and accompanied by ripe grape tomatoes, hard boilled egg, avacado  and lemon parmesan dressing which I got on the side.  I also asked for a lemon which I squeezed generously over the whole salad.  Bright and outrageously flavorful...I will make a point to get there again soon for that same dish."

So I showed my i'd, which was expired, but that's the reason why I used my passport. They couldn't accept that either. There were about 5 people in the place. Take the business, it wouldn't hurt."

I absolutely loved the seafood manicotti and many other dishes from the menu. It always tasted fresh and very homemade.\n\nPlus, my husband and I got engaged there. Not the most romantic ambiance some might say but it was perfect for us. \n\nGood bye Gavi, you will be missed."

It was a homemade sauce with lots of meat and even chunks of real tomatoes in it. The sauce was not sickeningly sweet and actually tasted pretty decent.\n\nThe bread was fresh on the table and the cold antipasti was excellent. Salads were fresh and not from a bag and the dressings were decent.\n\nA loud atmosphere inside and the crowding of the tables inside would be the only downfall. Also, they sat a party of four at a table that at most could fit 2 comfortably.\n\nService was decent, but not exceptional. There were times our table of four was ignored but drinks seemed to be refilled on a regular basis. Hostess staff was not impressive and seemed to be bored or uninterested and seemed to spend most of the time flirting with the waiters as they ran their tickets next to the host staff.\n\nFrom my two local Tucson natives, this location is better than the one on Broadway I believe.\n\nI wanted this to be a 4* review but due to the few shortcomings it will have to remain at 3. Not good for groups due to the small, crammed together tables and relatively few booths.\n\nTypical mall parking situation."

It's always packed and they have weekly specials and trivia.\n\nIt's very loud and mostly bar food but again the quality is there.  Service is as best as can be given the labor crisis which affects most small businesses in the country.  \n\nBiggest negative is they make you give a credit card when ordering. even when seated at a table.  Never experienced that in my life at a restaurant but not a deal killer.  I do highly recommend trying this place out.  Bring a jacket because you're in an ice hockey place."

I haven't found a great sushi place in South Jersey and I may or may not go back to this one because I'd like to try out a few other places.\n\nThe atmosphere is a little tacky, the music makes me feel like I want to fall asleep, but it seemed pretty clean. It took a little while for us to sit and order, there was only one girl working and one guy making the food. Nothing special on the service, not rude but not overly friendly.\n\nFood was good. I didn't get sushi, I got the vegetable hibachi and my boyfriend got a few vegetarian rolls. He enjoyed the cucumber & avocado and sweet potato roll, the squash roll isn't the typical squash we were expecting so I don't think that was one he really liked. The hibachi was good- green peppers, onions, carrots, broccoli all mixed on a plate with sauce and a side of fried rice. A little plain. Soup and salad comes with it, salad was good, the clear soup-not as good as I was hoping, I didn't eat much of it, it tasted a little off.\n\nOverall a decent place to eat. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but I won't kick and scream if I go back to eat."

It was a good portion & tasted really good. We split it. The mustard was a bit too much for me & burnt my nose. My husband loves meat and he said he wishes it had more meat it in. The side salad was very nice & refreshing, with great dressing."

I had the Farmers Market sandwich (add ham) and he had the taco. We shared the amazing challah French toast (only avail on weekends). The baked egg sandwiches are huge. We loved the outside patio and it's of course dog friendly. 10/10 for us. The espresso\nMachine was down which gave me the opportunity to walk to a coffee shop, Dart, down the street."

I loved it! \n\nAnyways, drinks: beer selection is weak, but I went into this understanding this is a winepub so no need to dock points there. Additionally, I was still able to find a great beer to satisfy me. We also ordered two carafes of wine which was top tier.\n\nThe food! Bacon wrapped dates were incredible and rich, the burrata and eggplant caponata was bright and light and paired with some fantastic bread, the LA crawfish grilled cheese was also rich and quite tasty while paired with a side of Cajun carrots that were unique, truffle fries were your run of the mill truffle fry experience, and the cornflake chicken sandwich was uhhhhh bland and not seasoned and the only bad part of our meal.\n\nPros: our waitress (I wish I could remember her name), the decorations, music, outdoor patio, the burrata and eggplant caponata, wine selection, the zony mash sour beer I settled on\n\nCons: that poor chicken sandwich\n\nClosing notes: absolutely will be back, as I already have a list of new menu items I want to try"

I got a regular margarita which was great while he got the \"Gentle Sage,\" which was also good. Service was great, just sad that the food wasn't to my expectation."

The dream mix smoothie is amazing as well as creating your own salad with fresh toppings such as chick peas, eggs, tomatoes, peppers, ham, etc."

The one who served me got my ice cream, left me to wait at the register a bit to serve someone else, and then asked me how it was despite the fact that it was visibly untouched; she was a tad busy. I used to think understaffed businesses just had owners who were being cheap, but in the COVID era who knows.\n\nI might have thought that my flavor choices of chocolate raspberry truffle and mint white chocolate oreo were unique, but I was bemused to read someone else's review where they ordered the same combination. These must be winning flavors. I actually liked the truffle even better than my mint chip but both were abundant in complexity. It was a mild winter day, but I did consider their large selection of specialty hot chocolates as well. They didn't seem to have much in the way of non-dairy frozen desserts, but their beverage selection offered multiple alternative milks so at least there's something if you need. I guess because they're open late downtown they see themselves as a bit of a convenience store as they had Tylenol and a few other random things for sale at the register.\n\nIt wasn't quite so good that I would rule out ever trying another dessert in Nashville, but their flavor selection is more than the basics and it is good."

Portion size was good as well, mine stretched into two meals along with the truffle fries which were crispy and golden, perfect amount of crunch.\n\nI would highly recommend stopping by if you ever see them out and about or need a lunch option for an event!"

On top of that there was maybe 1 crawfish in the etouffe. Was so disappointing!!! They even only give 2 of the smallest slices of bread with the etouffe..\n\nMaybe the food is better when not takeout."
