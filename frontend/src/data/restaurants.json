The place has limited seating and is self-serve only, so be prepared for a casual, no-frills dining setup.\n\nThe Three Cheese Grilled Sandwich and Tomato Soup were definitely the highlights\u2014rich, flavorful, and exactly what you\u2019d want from a classic comfort food combo. The Garlic Parmesan Fries were decent but didn\u2019t stand out, and the Spicy Chicken Sandwich was okay but not particularly memorable.\n\nIf you\u2019re craving a solid grilled cheese and soup, this spot is worth a visit."

The meat is very good and cooked to a perfect medium-well, though you can order a well done optionally.\n\nThis place is generous on the cheese and lean on the sauce, which means their bread doesn't get very soggy. The ingredients overall are good.\n\nThe soda is a local craft alternative that is very good, and on its own a huge plus.\n\nOverall, it is not necessarily special or fancy, and it is priced as an intermediate fast food place at what should be a bit over 15-20$ per person. But it is far preferable compared to The Habit, Five Guys, or Inn N Out."

However, service was very slow, the restaurant is very expensive and as it was a very cold day and they had their garage doors open, it was freezing inside. We ordered a lot of dishes as everything is shareable and the sizes of the dishes vary a lot. Some of the dishes have the same flavors like the sauce on the green beans and the loaded fries, as well as the chutney and salad. The chicken with lettuce cups was very bland. Our favorite was the poke salad."

We ordered the Crispy Quinoa Tuna Poke Salad, Pork Belly Biscuit, Yolk-Onomiyaki, Potato Crepe, and House Maple Sausage.  Everything was well seasoned and played beautifully.  A special treat to see Chef Izard in the kitchen training the goats.  \ud83d\udc10 Can\u2019t wait to check out dinner (especially the green beans!)"

We went later in the evening on a Sunday so there wasn't a ton of people inside which was nice. Our server was friendly & quick to take our orders and get our drinks out to us.\n\nThe food was delicious! We tried the Brotatoes as an appetizer which were so good. We all enjoyed the main dishes we picked out as well, everything was cooked exactly how we wanted it and everything was packed full of flavor. The California pasta I picked out was a zhuge hit for me! The flavors were on point. I would stop by again if I were to be in the area again.\n\nThe location was cute, it is in a historic area of town and is along side many other local restaurants & businesses in an easily walkable street."

The sandwich could've also used more cheese.\n\nThe chicken and waffles were also bland. This dish should be sweet and savory, but the waffle had no flavor, the syrup was not good, and the chicken strips were missing seasoning.\n\nMaybe we would've had better luck ordering something else. But if you're going to try either of these two, keep in mind they're bland. If you like bland, then these are the dishes for you!\n\nOur waitress was very kind. I believe her name was Wendy."

Visually, with its grand chandeliers and knocker back chairs, the place sets the mood for a great dining experience. Now, onto the experience.\nThe service was painfully slow. To be fair, Jenito did warn us about the delay, and given it was a Saturday night, we tried to be patient. But the wait to be seated and served felt excessive, even with the heads-up. The chicken soup came with an unexpected punch of coriander, but we were given vinegar and hot sauce right away when we asked for some. The chicken fried rice had a strange boiled rice aroma , and came with bits of coated chicken, which didn\u2019t quite hit the mark. The malai kebabs seemed overcooked. The chilli chicken was perfectly spicy and saucy. Honestly, their Indian menu might be the safer bet.  That said, Jenito stood out for being kind and attentive, checking in with another staff member about our food which we appreciated."

Tasted ok but I feel the taste of curry could have gone stronger.\n\nWe also got eggplant shrimp and chili beef. Both were good but definitely not the best we had.\n\nWe were comparing Burma Taste with other Burma food in the Bay Area, and we thought other Burma restaurant probably had better atmosphere and better tasting food. This place is ok and we\u2019ll prob go somewhere else.\n\nFor drinks, we really recommend Burma Dream cocktail! Very interesting mixture of mango flavor"

        "comment": "Ended up going to this place as we wanted a restaurant that serves both Spring Rolls and Gobi Manchurian, to satisfy all the cravings of our party. It wasn\u2019t crowded for a Thursday dinner. Needless to say, we ordered their Spring Rolls and Gobi Manchurian.\nSpring Rolls were crispy on the outside but the inside was indiscernible, no distinguishable veggies, just one paste/goo, probably potato. This is a 2/5.\nGobi Manchurian was a 3/5. The Gobi was crispy on the outside, just how it should be, but the sauce was a huge let down. It was very very ketchup-y.\nWe also ordered Veg Chowmein which was alright, but definitely not worth $16. No veggies of note, nothing expensive like broccoli or snap peas or anything. 3/5 for the taste, 2/5 for the price.\nThe only dish of note was the Nepalese Veg Thukpa which is soupy noodles, like Ramen. The soup was tasty although the turmeric in it was a bit overpowering. The noodles was the same as the one in chowmein. Good quantity. 4/5.\nDidn\u2019t try the momos.\nIn summary, I think Everest Cuisine is a better option for taste and definitely on the price, and the number of options. Or, there\u2019s always Inchin\u2019s Bamboo garden or Red Hot Chilli Pepper. Similarly priced but better taste and overall experience."

The big thick and juicy chicken was grilled perfectly and the vegetables were still hot and crunchy. Rice was moist and fluffy. Sauce wasn't overly sweet-a perfect compliment for the meal. A meal just like how I would make at home! I think I'll have to include this place in my usual lineup of weekly restaurants. I hope they will maintain these excellent standards."

The chicken wings were also good but they are basted in that thick, sticky, sweet sauce, so you gotta like that. Fried calamari was light and fluffy. Beers on tap of several varieties.\n\nService was fast to start, but we ordered the calamari in the \"second batch\" and they took 20+ minutes. Not cool. But this has a real brew pub atmosphere and there are games on the tv's. Pretty cool hangout spot."

During our recent visit, we indulged in the Shish Kabab\u2014a delightful skewer of marinated filet mignon, bell peppers, and onions, grilled to perfection over charcoal. The meat was incredibly juicy and tender, bursting with authentic flavors that transported us straight to the heart of Persia. Accompanied by fragrant saffron basmati rice and barbecued tomatoes, the dish was a harmonious blend of taste and tradition.  \ufffc \ufffc\n\nWe also sampled a variety of other meat dishes, including the Kabab Koobideh and Joojeh Kabab. Each was expertly prepared, showcasing the restaurant\u2019s commitment to quality and authenticity. The Kabab Koobideh, made from marinated lean ground beef, was flavorful and succulent, while the Joojeh Kabab featured tender chicken fillet pieces, marinated and garnished with saffron\u2014a true Persian delicacy.  \ufffc \ufffc\n\nThe ambiance of Chelokababi is warm and inviting, with elegant decor that enhances the dining experience. The staff were attentive and knowledgeable, providing excellent service throughout our meal. It\u2019s evident that Chelokababi takes pride in offering authentic Persian cuisine, making it a standout choice for anyone craving traditional flavors in the Bay Area.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a connoisseur of Persian food or new to the cuisine, Chelokababi offers a memorable dining experience that delights the senses. Highly recommended!"

Unfortunately, the ambiance left much to be desired-there was little atmosphere, the speakers were uncomfortably loud, and the temperature was quite warm, especially given the hot weather outside.\n\nThe drinks were underwhelming, and the appetizers were just average. The only standout dish was the chili chicken, which had some genuinely good flavor.\n\nOn a positive note, the service was excellent. Allwyn took great care of our group and was always attentive and responsive. His service was, in fact, the highlight of our evening.\n\nThe total bill came to about $40 per person. For that price, the experience felt far from upscale, and there are definitely better dining options available in the Bay Area at a similar cost."

As vegetarians, we were delighted to find so many veg options both in appetizers and main course. Desserts were okayish.\nThere were dahi kebab, crispy baby corn, paneer bakalava, paneer tikka wrap, samosa chaat, aloo tikki chaat and also live pani puri counter with 3 different pani (imli, pudina and orange) options. Veg main course included aloo poori, choley bhaturey, idli sambhar vada, paneer tikka, yellow dal tadka, veg pulav, hakka noodles and paneer manchurian.\nThey even served freshly made bhaturey, bedmi poori, aloo paratha and butter nan.\n\nAll in all it was worth $24 per person.\n\nStongly recommend!!"

I definitely felt like they were trying very hard to give us service to get tips and they are not very attentive. The environment was very cute and very modern. I liked their display of cocktail by the door when you walked in. I think overall consider their price. It\u2019s a little bit overrated. Also, they didn\u2019t provide us a bag when we asked for a box for takeout. It\u2019s not a big deal, but consider their price tag. I would say their service was not OK."

You will have to pay separately.\n\nDrinks price around $9ish.\nFoods is definitely overpriced. 1 (ONE) TACO priced for $6++-7++. Chicken bowl priced starting $15++. Burger alone is around $18++ (without fries).\n\nTotal food (3 tacos) and 1 drink will cost you around $35.\n\nAmbience: quiet, cozy, good to play cards with a group of friends.\n\nBathroom: 1 (one) unisex, clean, well maintained.\n\nParking: free street parking."

The menu is purely vegetarian and packed with classic options\u2014from masala dosa to pongal to filter coffee that\u2019s strong and satisfying.\n\nThe place can get very busy, especially on weekends, so expect a bit of a wait. It\u2019s more of a no-frills, fast-casual experience\u2014don\u2019t go in expecting fancy ambiance, but the food more than makes up for it.\n\nEverything is flavorful, fresh, and reasonably priced. Their chutneys and sambar are standout, and they\u2019re generous with portions too. Definitely a favorite for South Indian comfort food in the Bay Area."

I've had sandwiches from all the major chains, and these sandwiches have been the best by far. They don't skimp on meats like many other chains have been doing lately. I came here close to their closing time, and they still accommodated me with extremely friendly service. I got the garlic pesto turkey sandwich and it was large and delicious. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area. TL;DR - kind service and amazing sandwiches (better than any other local option)"

I had to order the sourdough bread bowl with the clam chowder for my first visit, but so many of their options were sounding very tempting!\nFood came out very quickly and both the bread bowl and soup were piping hot! The sourdough has a nice crunchy texture and is clearly freshly baked, the soup is also very tasty! As you can see in the picture they do not skimp on the soup either!\nWas a very satisfying lunch, will definitely come back again and try one of their other dishes. The French dip sandwich, for one, is calling out to me already!"

        "comment": "The menu suggests there is London as an influence (Britain, UK) but they have strayed a bit from this.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s not bad at all, and I think they have done well to keep the menu size down. They could just be a little more authentic.\n\nScotch eggs: These were good. Could take a little more salt and pepper but tasty. They are ground lamb scotch eggs, which is not the traditional variety from the UK. Ground pork is the traditional coating around the egg. Great to see the eggs not rock hard inside. Just cooked nicely. And beautifully presented. I would suggest add a small fork to the serving platter if it is being shared. As a group, nobody wanted to use their own \u201cused\u201d fork to take some coleslaw from the platter.\n\nFish and chips: In the UK fish and chips is served with a piece of fish, typically a fillet or half fillet from the side of the fish. However, here as with most US fried fish presentation, there are rectangular pieces of fish battered and fried. I don\u2019t know why they do this. It is not British though \ud83d\ude06.. There is a side of mushy peas for an extra $2. Don\u2019t waste your money!! They are just the Birds Eye frozen peas (or similar brand), mashed up with a fork. Not mushy peas at all. We did give the feedback but they still charged for them. If you are serving fish and chips and offering mushy peas, have the mushy peas available. Mushy peas are marrowfat peas, not frozen garden peas. A good brand to buy is Bachelors. They are available in tins or dried (if using dried: soak, add bicarb and salt and boil - google the recipe and really make them authentic!)\n\nBangers & Mash (Sausages): Very good. The sausages were good, the mash very good, and kale went well and not over cooked. If this establishment gets proper mushy peas, they could offer them as a kale alternative, as this would also be British in style.\n\nService was pretty good, though the bangers and mash took significantly longer to arrive while everyone politely waited to start eating.\n\nWould I go back? Yes."

        "comment": "I came here to celebrate my father's birthday.\n\nUpon arrival, we were greeted and there was plenty of seating for my party. All the main entrees on the menu were pretty expensive and did not strike me as very appetizing.\n\nUpon ordering, the food took forever (20-30 minutes) to arrive at my table, despite the business not looking very busy on a Saturday night.\n\nI ordered the Fish and Chips which I assumed was the safe option but turned out to be a mistake. The fish was extremely bland and I had to nearly force myself to finish once I exhausted the small portion of dipping sauce that accompanied the dish. The chips were decent. Overall I enjoyed the appetizer the most which was a deep-fried Macaroni and Cheese plate.\n\nTo the restaurants credit, they did provide my father a complimentary dessert which he seemed to enjoy.\n\nOverall, my party did not enjoy the food or experience enough to be keen on returning for a 2nd time in the near future."

They were long fries coated in a cheese powder with a spicy almost gochujang like sauce. The chicken was nice and crispy, the meat was the right amount of firm inside. Overall the flavor coating on the chicken was a good pick, definitely does not make you feel over-sauced at the end. Place gets busy during the dinner rush. Otherwise, very chill place to grab a bite and chitchat. Service was fast and enough parking outside in the plaza."

Perfectly crispy, spicy, and bursting with flavor\u2014it\u2019s everything you\u2019d expect and more. Their Hyderabad Chicken Dum Biryani is a masterpiece, capturing the authentic aroma and taste that only true Hyderabadi biryani can deliver. The Gongura Mutton Biryani is a delightful reminder of home, with the tangy gongura perfectly complementing the tender mutton.\n\nAnd let\u2019s talk about the Kalakand\u2014so fresh and buttery, it melts in your mouth like a sweet dream. Pairing all this with a chilled Thumbs Up made the experience complete.\n\nThis place has truly brought a piece of Hyderabad to Sunnyvale, and I can\u2019t wait to go back for more! A must-visit for anyone craving that irreplaceable Hyderabadi love in every bite."

I\u2019ve not seen it to be fully packed ever, neither during lunch nor dinner. The service isn\u2019t the fastest but absolutely love everything that we order. Of course, I have no semblance to what \u201cauthentic\u201d Mexican is, but the food is tasty, served hot, loaded with veggies. The house hot sauce is one of the best I\u2019ve tried. Good amount of options for veggies. Veggie quesadilla is very tasty and filling. The Chile Relleno de Vegetales was good (it is deep fried in egg batter). Enchiladas Verdes is really good too. Chile en Nogada is very different, with fruits and nuts, enjoyable though. Overall, a place that consistently delivers."

Like, the kind of menu where you stare at it for 10 minutes thinking, am I hungry or just emotionally unprepared to make a decision?\n\nHad the spicy noodle soup before fantastic. Fresh spring rolls? Honestly hard to beat. But this time I went for the house special rice clay pot and it blew me away. Full of flavor, perfectly balanced, and straight-up comfort food for the soul.\n\nAlso tried the BBQ gluten vermicelli refreshing and super flavorful. Doesn\u2019t even feel like \u201cvegetarian food,\u201d it just tastes good.\n\nShowed up on a Saturday around 2pm thinking I could sneak in between the lunch rush\u2026absolutely wrong. The place was packed. But for good reason.\n\nThis is definitely one of those spots you keep coming back to just to explore the menu. Every dish feels like a new main character."

After visiting here, I would definitely recommend it as an economical option for anyone that wants to enjoy decent southeast Asian vegan food! Almost every dish was below $15 which made it really affordable, on top of what I had being extremely tasty!\n\nThe establishment's slogan about promoting vegan dining is very clear, and as much as I am not vegan myself, I love it when veganism is available as an option. As a result, I ordered the eggplant tofu clay pot, which was amazingly delicious. While I was not sure what house special sauce they had used, it definitely tasted a bit like there was garlic sauce included, which made the eggplant tasty. One can pour some of the sauce on top of the given rice, which I ended up picking brown rice, and it would make the whole thing super tasty. Either way, I very much enjoyed it. In terms of the spring rolls, they tasted as good as I imagined it to be, because the peanut sauce carried the main flavor when dipping the rolls in it. Mint leaves, tofu, vegetables altogether allowed a mixture of different flavors that made it a pleasant culinary experience. The tom kha tasted  more sour than sweet, most likely because it didn't have enough coconut milk, which wasn't a bad thing and would be dependent on different people's tastes.\n\nOverall I think this establishment is one that anyone can easily trust to create good, quick, and cheap food. While I don't live around the area, I would recommend it to anyone who does."

The decor is simple and the interiors reminded me of an old Pakistani college canteen.\n\nWe went around dinner time so there were a bit of a crowd, but we quickly found place to sit and ordered a number of things. The appetizers are good, especially dahi puri was presented well and tasted good.\n\nThe zinger burger was ok, and I wished it had more zing in it than just deep fried breaded chicken. The anday wala burger aka bun kabob took the cake. It was very nicely done. The texture and flavor were excellent. The sauce tangy and nice. Overall a great item to eat here.\n\nWe also tried the paratha chicken roll which was at par.\n\nService is good and they kept the place clean and good. The outside seating area was rained out when we visited but could make for a good place to eat.\n\nOverall, a good experience."

Everything was delicious, especially the Crazy Curry Fries.\nAlthough I really enjoyed the food, it might be a bit strong in terms of spice for some people. For example, the Crazy Curry Fries contain cilantro, so if you're not a fan, be cautious. As for the Bomb Kebob, while I liked it and found it flavorful, the spice level was somewhat strong, so keep that in mind."

I cannot believe how much I enjoyed their organic chicken soup. It was so delicious and the basil in there hit the mark.  I squeezed in some of the lime after using it on the grilled chicken.  So darn tasty. The pupusa was also very delicious.  I could pass on the corn tortilla but that's only because I didn't grow up with this staple.

It's definitely better than a place I visited a few weeks back. I would say this will be a good option for me when craving MY food. Will absolutely save me miles from going to San Francisco for pupusas.\n\nYou order at register, and then it's open seating. They have pretty good indoor and outdoor seating. Depending on the time of your visit, this may or may not vary.\n\nI ordered the plato tipico because I wanted to taste multiple items in 1 visit. The curtido and salsa were missing some of the authentic flavor for me, but it was still delicious.\n\nThe service could use a little improvement. We waited a while as the cashier took calls. Food took a while to come out. We were not checked on, and I had to call the waitress over when anything was needed, but they were not rude.\n\nIt's not a 1 hit wonder, so when that craving hits, I have an option to visit."

The beers are good and they have a solid selection of cocktails, but limited mocktail options and no non alcoholic beers.  We love the pizza here! So many fun flavors."

I say get a second sweet mustard because you\u2019re going to want to re-dip that thing on repeat. The Salmon / Mediterranean bowl is the way to go for those of us who want to stay snatched and I\u2019d say a solid round of red wines and cava to round out the night if beer is not your thing. Our server was awesome! Juan! And the Laughing Monk should be lucky to have him as this was a packed night but he nailed this crazy packed section with ease and grace sans was the best and just as upbeat and fun as this restaurant. We entered laughing and exited laughing knowing all monks would be proud!"

The Sichuan dish had the perfect amount of spice, and the wonton soup was comforting and rich. Portions were generous, and the prices were very reasonable\u2014our total was just under $62. Friendly service from Cindy made the experience even better. Highly recommend for casual, delicious Chinese food!"

The veggie burger is very similar to veggie black bean burger available at Costco, if not the same. Second they made prepared one burger with sliced cheese and wax paper of that cheese slice as well. When we showed this to restaurant we had to state what burger it was. We got a replacement veggie burger with bacon on it. Other burger we got had a fried egg included, but by the time it was at table the egg was broken and yolk was seeping through the wrapper.

The drinks were great too, the service was outstanding from the moment I contacted Bruce (the manager) , he was prompt in his responses, shared lots of information  helping us make the best decision about our celebration. Once we arrived to the event with our decorations Bruce and  his staff (three waiters) were all hand on,  the tables were already set up as well as multiple heaters because I was concerned we were going to be cold in the patio (we were not cold at all). They help us to set up the  flower arraignments and  ballons we had brought, they also  made sure the fire pits were ready as well as the different games they have four out teen guest, the \"water pong\" was an all time  favorite given my teens a \"college like experience\". In addition  Bruce allow us to  play our own music making our event feel completely personalize.  The party was a great success, our guest were happy, we were  very comfortable  with the bill. Clara's Junction is going to be our to go place for  events. I highly recommend them. The facilities, the manager, the staff, the food and the cost is amazing. Great value.  I am glad their are the new addition to our North Santa Clara neighborhood."

Classic dishes you would expect from any Italian restaurant, but not find them available as easily. Good value for money and family owned restaurant vibe. Will try lasagna next time. My colleagues commented how their seafood pasta\u2019s shrimps have a stronger fishy taste than expected; however, my prawns in my pasta were fine."

Portions are normal for a Benedict and price is competitive with similar restaurants.\nOur waitress Magdalena C was very friendly, attentive and professional and gave to us a few tips about when it\u2019s a good time to go in weekend and weeks days.\nFor a dinner style restaurant it\u2019s very nice decor and ambiance.\nDefinitely I\u2019ll be back to try other dishes, because they have lunch, dinner and breakfast all day\nThank you very much, was a pleasant experience."

We tried the eureka salad with steak, the Asian salad and the truffle fries.\nThe steak was great. The veggies were crisp and fresh, the dressings were not overpowering flavors. The truffle fries were amazing. Warm and just the right amount of crispy. We did ent have any drinks but they had tons of options. Our server Taylor was really nice and attentive.

        "comment": "I had the pleasure of dining at JOEY Restaurant at Valley Fair in Santa Clara, and I must say\u2014this is a welcome addition to the culinary scene near Santana Row. From the moment I entered, I was struck by the sophisticated yet approachable ambiance. The space is modern, well-appointed, and thoughtfully designed to balance lively energy with comfort, ideal for both casual lunches and special gatherings.\n\nWe began our experience with a selection of starters. The Sushi Cone was a standout\u2014featuring tempura shrimp wrapped in a crisp seaweed shell with avocado, spicy mayo, and a delicate pop of tobiko. It delivered a balanced bite of texture and umami that lingered pleasantly.\n\nThe Scallop & Shrimp Ceviche brought bright flavors to the table with avocado, red onion, cilantro, mint, and a lemongrass-pineapple dressing. While I appreciated the creativity and tropical flair, I found the lemongrass slightly overpowering and might have preferred a version that leaned more toward a classic Peruvian-style ceviche. That said, the seafood was fresh and expertly prepared, and the housemade yellow corn tortilla chips offered a great vehicle for each bite.\n\nNext came the Spicy Crab Dip, served warm with grilled artisan sourdough. The dip itself was decadent and filled with sweet lump crab meat\u2014clearly the star of the dish. My only note would be the ratio of bread to dip; a bit less bread or a thinner cut might allow the dip to shine more prominently.\n\nFor mains, the Sake Glazed Chilean Seabass was nothing short of exceptional. The fish was cooked to a perfect flake, with the richness of the seabass beautifully complemented by the savory-sweet glaze. Accompanied by wok-fired vegetables, gold potatoes, and immersed in a dashi broth, this dish delivered depth and warmth\u2014a comforting yet refined plate.\n\nThe JOEY Classic Steak\u2014a 7 oz prime top sirloin\u2014was also a success. Cooked precisely to temperature, it was well-seasoned and juicy, and the real surprise came in the form of their fully loaded crispy mashed potatoes. These were unlike any I\u2019ve had before\u2014creamy inside, crisp on the outside, and topped with an indulgent array of toppings. We paired this dish with a bottle of Daou from Paso Robles, a red that offered bold fruit and elegant structure, enhancing the richness of the steak.\n\nService throughout was professional, attentive, and genuinely warm. Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and offered insightful wine pairings without being intrusive.\n\nIn conclusion, JOEY Valley Fair is a restaurant that balances culinary ambition with crowd-pleasing appeal. While a few minor tweaks could elevate certain dishes, the overall experience was polished, satisfying, and thoughtfully curated. I look forward to returning and exploring more of the menu. This is a strong contender for one of the best upscale-casual dining spots in Santa Clara.\n\nBravo to the team\u2014and welcome to the neighborhood!"

        "comment": "Soft opening for Joey Valley Fair. The vibe of the place is gorgeous; Casablanca meets California. We were seated on the second floor that high open ceilings that closed as the night chill came. All the staff were friendly and helpful. Every table was full so service was a bit slow but we munched on our chicken lettuce wraps and miso mushrooms both tasty so didn\u2019t mind the wait. For entrees we ordered Baja tacos, steak and lobster and steak and sushi. My steak was a little cold but had a good flavor. Sushi was not traditional looking but tasty. Others tried the cr\u00e8me brulee cheesecake which they enjoyed.  Overall great experience and impressed for first night."

We tried the Shakarkandi/sweet potato chaat, paani puri - both good appetizers but the gobi manchurian look alike was a bomb! The paneer biryani bowl was only satisfactory, sadly because of the overpowering cardamom and the dal could have used a little more salt. Both, the pineapple and mango mojito mocktails were refreshing! Definitely going back to try more."

The bar is stunning and sets the tone for a fun, elevated dining experience.\n\nWe started with the chips & molcajete salsa and the classic guac\u2014both super fresh and packed with flavor. Then came the passion fruit & mango shrimp ceviche and yellowfin tuna crudo\u2026 just wow. So refreshing, bright, and beautifully plated. The tamarindo shrimp tacos were a flavor bomb\u2014sweet, tangy, and perfectly balanced.\n\nBut what really made the night was the bartender. We sat at the bar and got completely spoiled with tequila tastings\u2014he walked us through flavor profiles, suggested perfect pairings, and made us feel like VIPs. You can tell they take pride in the experience just as much as the food.\n\nCan\u2019t wait to come back\u2014Puesto is a whole vibe."

Upon entry, My husband and I stood around with our 3 children for 15 minutes with not even so much as an approach or Acknowledgement to seat us. (The restaurant wasn't packed at all) Finally, they got someone to seat us in the corner. And walked away immediately after seating us. No utensils. No waters. No, 'a server will be with you guys shortly' nothing. We sat there another 15min with absolutely no one to approaching us, I accounted it to being short of staff but then people were being sat down after us & served drinks immediately. At that point, with 3 anxious children 3, 5 & 9yrs old- we just got up & walked out.\n\nCustomer service was poor- only because we didn't recieve absolutely any service at all.\nCan't comment on the food since we didn't even get a sip of water.\nJust going to stick to boiling crab.\n\nWalked right over next door to Pho Hoa, immediately was approached by staff, given waters right after we were seated & within the 1st 2 min. Another staff approached to take drink & food orders. Totally different vibe. Much more packed. & more of a vibrant atmosphere.\n\nRoasted Crab was just so disappointing. \ud83d\ude44\n& we've been wanting to try this place out for a LONG time now since we only go to Boiling Crab."

Literally told me, everyone's prices are increasing with inflation and that I \"didn't have to eat there\". Damn right I don't, so I had them return my money. Keep your overpriced dry turkey sandwich. Actual reality is this: everyone's prices are increasing because it's trickle down price gouging from suppliers.\n\nAre you really going to try and rationalize $15 for couple layers of turkey, a slice of tomato, bread and cheese? Get real."

Would recommend coming early or late.\nWe had the croissant French Toast which was very heavy and the jumbo crab bene was pretty good. They don't have cappuccino or latte which was a bummer, but they do serve regular coffee."

Parking was a bit hard to find since it was super busy. We had to circle the lot a few times and wait for some people to leave. We sat outside, and there were some space heaters so it wasn't too cold. The sandwiches are definitely worth it."

Ingredients were fresh but the food lacked any real distinct flavor. Solidly cooked standard fare. Mozzarella cheese to start with was excellent but accompanying bread was borderline stale in its chewiness. Chicken kebab was fine as was ravioli, nothing that would draw you back"

There has been only 4-5 options in veg that we could order for main course.The name of appetizers were quite interesting but sadly the taste was not great. However I did order pina colada which tasted like cold milk but the server saw me not liking the drink and he came forward and got me another drink called billionaire which was good .The ambience is great there and food quality is good . The overall service was also good so\nI am definitely going there again and cheers to festive season with wonderful decoration.we ordered churros in the end which was quite disappointing too but due to their service I would\nLike to give them 3.5 stars."

The stone bowl bibimbap is my favorite here, I order with tofu and vegetables. Many side dishes provided. The Korean bbq meats can be a bit expensive. Like every Korean bbq, you have to order two meat dishes, which can come out to at least $100 bucks. That\u2019s a bit much on my end, but my wife says the meat quality is fantastic. The service is fantastic - the ladies always do a great job here. We keep coming back with friends."

I was seated right next to a private room, and the door kept opening and hitting my chair throughout the evening\u2014really distracting and annoying.\n\nThe waitstaff were friendly overall, but some of the service felt rushed\u2014at one point, utensils were dropped onto the table rather than placed properly. As for the food, the steaks had good flavor but were a bit too tough, with a lot of tendon that made them hard to chew.\n\nUnfortunately, I wouldn\u2019t recommend this location for a company gathering. For the price and setting, I expected a more comfortable and polished experience."

Plus the lamb has really good flavor, especially coupled with the hot sauce. I wasn\u2019t a big fan of the driving radish, or whatever the crunchy, purple vegetable was in there but I admit it does add a different taste kick. And the fries were perfectly crispy! Sounds weird, but I really liked those. I couldn\u2019t resist and got a chocolate, hazelnut Turkish delight for dessert. So. Good. Really friendly restaurant manager."

From the moment we arrived, we were greeted warmly by the hostess with a heartfelt \"Happy Anniversary,\" setting a wonderful tone for the lunch.\n\nWe were seated in a semi-private area, away from the crowd, which made our celebration feel even more intimate. Our waiter, Andrew, immediately greeted us with another \"Happy Anniversary,\" and from that moment on, he made our dining experience unforgettable. He expertly guided us through the menu, suggesting some of his personal favorites while allowing us ample time to make our selections.\n\nWhen it was time to order, Andrew surprised us with complimentary RH Bellinis to kick off the celebration-such a thoughtful touch. We decided on crispy artichokes, truffle fries, and the Chinese chicken salad. My husband opted for the thinly shaved ribeye French dip, while I went for the lobster roll, topped with caviar per Andrew's recommendation.\n\nThe French dip was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and my lobster roll was overflowing with fresh lobster--absolutely delicious. The Chinese chicken salad was another standout: the chicken was incredibly juicy, and the crispy fried noodles added the perfect crunch.\n\nFor dessert, we kept it simple with coffee and decided we would just share a chocolate chip cookie. To our surprise, Andrew brought out not one, but three warm cookies, telling us they were \"on the house\" to celebrate our anniversary.\n\nAndrew, your attention to detail and dedication to making our day special truly made all the difference. We will always remember your kindness and can't wait to return to RH Rooftop, becuase of YOU. Thank you for making our anniversary unforgettable!"

But we mostly came for the vibes and the view, so no biggie. Well, joke\u2019s on us because the food was fantastic!\nFrom the creamy burrata to the fancy lobster rolls with caviar, from the delicate blini also with caviar, to the warm shrimp salad, and finally, the perfectly grilled branzino - we devoured everything like we hadn\u2019t seen food in weeks. Every bite was a love story.\nNow, was the service a bit slow? Yes. Did we contemplate aging gracefully while waiting for our next dish? Also yes. And sure, the prices made our wallets shed a tear. But at the end of the day, with that view, that food, and that experience\u2014we left full, happy, and only slightly financially wounded. Worth it!"

Many dishes, like the skewers and the mushrooms in the quail appetizer, leaned heavily on overly sweet flavors, which didn\u2019t suit my taste. To top it off, they forgot to include cheese on my son\u2019s burger\u2014an oversight we only realized after seeing photos of the same dish from other reviewers when we got back home. My son found the burger too dry and complained, though to their credit, the restaurant didn\u2019t charge us for it. Overall, I found it to be overpriced, and the experience left much to be desired."

Our guests raved about the food all night and the servers/managers were so kind with everyone from adults to kids at our reception. Sound system was great. Was the perfect intimate venue for our small reception and we will definitely be coming back for the food! Derya was our coordinator and was so kind, patient, and calm throughout all our interactions!"

All the food and drinks were delicious, the quality of the products was top notch, the designer presentation and combination of flavors is the mastery of this place. European hospitality deserves special thanks. The service is very professional, pleasant. I wish this restaurant chain was all over America.\nThe people who work there really make this place great. Thanks to manager Olga, bartender Ilkhom, waiters Kirill and Rene for the pleasant experience."

The quality was there, but the experience didn\u2019t feel the same. That said, I\u2019d still recommend it.\n\nThe highlight of the meal was definitely the sides. I had either the garlic fries or truffle fries (can\u2019t quite remember), but they were absolutely amazing\u2014crispy, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. Their deep-fried items are surprisingly excellent, with the tempura shrimp standing out as one of the best I\u2019ve had. The strawberry arugula salad was also phenomenal, fresh, and well-balanced.\n\nService was just okay. Our server wasn\u2019t bad, but they didn\u2019t really engage much, and the interaction felt a little dry. It wasn\u2019t a bad experience, but it didn\u2019t enhance the meal either.\n\nOverall, I\u2019d give this place four stars, but it\u2019s almost a three. The food, especially the deep-fried options and salad, pushes it up, but service and the prime rib experience could use some improvements. I\u2019d still recommend it, but with a few caveats."

        "comment": "Our experience at this restaurant was disappointing, especially considering the price. We ordered the Prime Rib medium, but it arrived medium well and was very dry. The sea bass ($49.95) lacked flavor unless eaten with the sauce. On a positive note, the bread, lobster bisque, and baked potato were great, and our waiter was very nice.\n\nHowever, the overall service left much to be desired. I had booked this reservation to celebrate a birthday, yet instead of offering anything special, they canceled it because of late arrival without notice. We were late due to a full parking lot and limited street parking, and we found that our reservation was already canceled, even though the restaurant never mentioned a late-arrival policy during the booking process. Despite plenty of available seats, the front desk staff gave us an attitude. While we were eventually seated, we were told we had only 1 hour and 15 minutes to dine because of upcoming reservations.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t visit again. For a similar price, I\u2019d recommend House of Prime Rib, where both the service and food quality are significantly better."

The other dishes all the same. Food is not the attraction here, it\u2019s the ambience and location, but you could find that many other places and get a nice dinner while you\u2019re at it\n\nAlso the hours are posted as midnight but they closed shop at 10:30 and pushed us all out.

I really enjoyed the bright, surrounded by the greenery plants and the natural light that shines in. The food was great, and they're mostly from local farmers. Lots of healthy options you can substitute and good portions (I had the omelette and it was is enough to feed two). The service is also great, our waitress not only was sweet but also very tentative. Definitely will come back soon to try out other items on the menus.\n\nPlease park in the garage on Bryant Street if you can't find street parking."

Pork paella was delicious, especially crispy. Eggplant chips are so unique and tasty. The Gambas al pil pil was delicious too."

It\u2019s been a long time since a restaurant has blown my socks off but I have to say this restaurant is truly exceptional!  From the moment my party walked in the door the host was welcoming. The atmosphere was warm and cozy.  We were promptly seated by and brought drinks by our waitress Sylvia.  The drinks were delicious and kept refreshed throughout the meal.  Appetizers were incredible, tasty and plenty to share.  My main course the steak cooked perfectly and melts in my mouth with every bite!  Over all, best meal I have had in a long time. Thank you to the staff, Sylvia, David, the tall host and three gentlemen who helped with the table. Truly excellent service!  Will be visiting every time I visit San Francisco!!!"

The breakfast I chose was the bar which included eggs, bacon, potatoes, and French toast. Cereal, coffee, OJ, and toast was available as well a 8 varieties of fruit.\n\nFor dinner, I started with the cheese plate and finished with the Soleil Burger with Gilroy fries.  Long Islands were outstanding. The cheese plate was excellent and served with toast. The burger was cooked to perfection with bacon and cheddar."

It was a little too chilly for the covered patio even tho it was a heated patio so we sat inside. It smelled like a greasy spoon with a strong burger smell. We were seated right away and given menus. The menu really does range from poolside items like popcorn, chicken to nicer fare like a petite fillet. We ordered truffle fries to start and they were pretty greasy, but otherwise good. We weren\u2019t too confident at this point, but we ordered the salmon and the petite fillet anyways. When they arrived, they were absolutely beautiful, like a fine dining experience. They tasted very, very good! We were quite surprised and happy and finished everything on our plate. The next day I ordered veggie tempura for room service and it was greasy just like the french fries. It seems like if you stay away from the fried food, you\u2019ll be good to go here. I can\u2019t speak for the Drinks, but the service was super kind and warm and efficient. It\u2019s not a fancy place, but they do have fancy food."

We were looking forward to a pleasant afternoon on the rooftop bar. Upon our arrival, we found that the staff seemed tired, likely from a busy happy hour rush.\n\nI can't rave about the cocktails or food, as we only tried a couple of dishes, but the view, ambiance, and decor were undeniably appealing. We're definitely considering returning when the weather is more favorable.\n\nOverall, the President's Terrace is an excellent spot for unwinding with friends or colleagues after work. It doesn\u2019t seem to accommodate large parties with limited seating. It's also festive and charming, making it a great choice for a fun date as well."

The fried calamari was quite perfect as it had a light and crispy coating, adding a satisfying crunch without overpowering the flavour of the squid.\n\nThe gnocchi was delicious, but a bit too saucy for my taste, which made the dish feel a bit heavy. I would have preferred a lighter coating to let the gnocchi shine more.\n\nOverall, this is a lovely spot in Palo Alto as it offers a cozy and relaxed ambiance. I\u2019d be\nopen to try different locations as well!"

It was supposed to be my lunch for the following day but ended up in the basura.  I had the lasagna as well.  That I was able to stomach but I was not impressed by that either but the presentation was much nicer. Sorry no photo."

I\u2019m guessing the appeal of this place for a lot of people is the beautiful presentation of the food or the setting. Or maybe the unique mochi waffle offering. But in my opinion, the food is just okay. Yes, even the mochi waffles are just okay. Nothing bad at all but it\u2019s overrated."

We came in a week beforehand to sample and select wines and appetizers, which was extremely helpful, and they worked with us to customize the set menu and room setup exactly how we envisioned it for a milestone birthday celebration.\n\nOne of the standout aspects was how accommodating the staff was. They allowed us to arrive a few hours early to decorate, and they went above and beyond\u2014even helping us take everything down at the end of the night, which we really appreciated because it was a lot! Every member of the staff and management (Antonio) was incredibly kind, helpful, and patient throughout the evening.\n\nOur dedicated server was lovely\u2014attentive and warm\u2014making sure everyone was taken care of. Guests who wanted to take home their leftovers were easily able to do so because they serve excellent portions.\n\nWhat really made the night extra special was that our party of 15 ppl had the private room for the entire evening. We came to set up at 3 pm and were one of the last groups to close it out. That kind of flexibility is rare and made the whole event feel unrushed and intimate.\n\nThe food? Outstanding. Every dish was delicious, and the wines were a hit across the board. As people who\u2019ve worked and travel around Italy, we were genuinely impressed by the authenticity of the flavors\u2014it brought us right back to the Tuscan countryside.\n\nWe\u2019ve also dined in the main restaurant during regular service, and the vibe there is equally charming\u2014casual yet elegant, with a warm, rustic Italian ambiance.\n\nHuge kudos to the team at iTalico\u2014you helped us create such a memorable evening. We\u2019ll absolutely be back for more family gatherings, celebrations, and cozy date nights."

All the dishes we ordered were quite good from the lamb to the octopus and pizza. Desserts were delicious as well including the Tiramisu and Panna Cotta."

Most places are either really generic or very expensive and out of reach. This is right in the sweet spot. Well priced for the portions and value. Insanely tasty - about as good as Mexico. We really enjoyed the birria, cochinita, ceviche, and guacamole. Recommend you get family style so everyone can try. Definitely will be back!"

We ordered the dry-aged ribeye\u2014the cowboy, requested medium rare, but it arrived rare and was even a bit cold in the center a perfect rare steak! We ate it anyway and didn\u2019t mind too much and didn\u2019t want to send it back! The potatoes were drenched in butter not my style.\nOne cool thing that they do is melt the compound butter table side, this makes it a nice presentation. I really wanted to love this place but it lacked flavor in my opinion. will keep exploring the area!"

The shrimp were juicy\u2014maybe a bit on the oily side\u2014but still delicious, and the chicken was super crispy and perfectly seasoned. We also had the Tierra y Mar, which came in a generous portion and was packed with flavor. The skirt steak was tender, juicy, and full of beefy goodness. The coconut shrimp were excellent\u2014not overly sweet, just naturally so\u2014and the asparagus was cooked perfectly. The whole place, including the bathrooms, was impeccably clean. Great experience overall!"

Only disappointment was that some of the vegetarian options couldn\u2019t be made vegan despite being listed as such but overall everyone enjoyed the food."

In my opinion, the portions were just right; each flavor was individually enjoyable, and together, they formed a delightful combination. The bread was delicious, and from the moment it was brought to your table, it emitted a wonderful aroma (it's served hot).\n\nThe staff is friendly and helpful. Knowing it's a popular place, I went on a Thursday during lunchtime. I didn't have to wait for a table (although I got the last available one outside), and the food arrived promptly. Just as most reviews suggest, it's a lovely place to spend time and enjoy your meal without rushing."

The kababs were smoky, juicy, and bursting with spices that danced on the tongue, perfectly paired with a buttery, flaky paratha. The chai was warm and fragrant, with just the right touch of cardamom \u2014 pure comfort in every sip.\n\nAnd then came the mango soft serve. Mind-blowingly amazing. Bursting with the sweet, floral essence of real mangoes, it was like tasting summer in Karachi.\n\nZareen\u2019s doesn\u2019t just serve food \u2014 they serve memory, emotion, and love on a plate. I\u2019ll definitely be back for their Friday biryani and nihari."

From start to finish, everything was flawless. The chefs behind the bar weren\u2019t just masters of their craft\u2014they were passionate, engaging, and truly made our night memorable. Watching them prepare each dish with precision and pride added such a unique and intimate touch to the experience.\n\nEvery bite was exceptional\u2014from the toro topped with caviar and gold leaf to the perfectly seared wagyu served sizzling on a hot stone. The hamachi jalape\u00f1o, crispy rice, salmon nigiri, and matcha dessert were standouts, both in flavor and presentation.\n\nThey even surprised us with a custom dessert to celebrate our special occasion\u2014just one more reason why the service felt so warm and personal.\n\nDining at Nobu is more than just a meal\u2014it\u2019s an experience. If you're in Palo Alto, make sure to sit at the bar, trust the chefs, and enjoy the ride. We'll absolutely be back."

The pi\u00f1a martini was amazing as it had a slight pineapple acidity and wasn\u2019t too strong. The sake we had (Devil Killer) was absolutely amazing. Very smooth and has a slight spicy finish to it. My family got the prime filet tobonyaki and the black cod miso and they were both outstanding. The filet came out on a hot sizzling platter and the texture of the steak was buttery and perfect. Some of the best steak I\u2019ve ever had. The black miso cod had this sweet glaze to it and flaked off perfectly. A slight salty taste to it that meshed well with the sweet glaze. The crab tempura was fried perfectly. It came with some sauce that was slightly sweet and paired very well with the crab. The tempura sushi roll I had was pretty good. Very straight forward. The snow crab nigiri, unagi nigiri and tuna nigiri were okay. I\u2019m a bit harder on sushi as it\u2019s hard to compare to Japan but it\u2019s very good. The meat on the nigiri was a bit dry, taking away some of the flavor from it. The tuna was a bit fishy but the unagi was pretty good. The xurros had a lemon filling on the inside but it was very light and had subtle flavors. Great way to end the dinner. The coconut ice cream was also light and creamy with a slight crunch to it. The zen garden dessert was refreshing and the fruits and matcha all mixed together very well. Really good place to go to !"

The flavors are fresher, more inventive, and every bite feels thoughtfully prepared. The burger was hearty and satisfying, while the sweet potato hash had the perfect balance of smooth texture and natural sweetness. Unlike other fast-casual restaurants that sometimes feel generic, True Food\u2019s menu feels chef-driven and genuinely nourishing, with vibrant ingredients. The service was prompt and friendly, making the takeout experience seamless. If you\u2019re debating where to get your next healthy meal, True Food Kitchen is absolutely worth choosing over others for staff interaction, quality, and taste."

The crust had a great taste and was perfectly chewy and crunchy. Both slices were delicious.\nThe only downside was the service. Those slices were so delicious that I wanted to order a whole pizza to take home for my family. There were two workers at the front that were standing there talking behind the register. I was standing at the front of the register with my card out ready to order. They completely ignored me for two or three minutes. A group of people walked in and one of the workers slid over to his right to take their order. The pizza is good, so I will go back again, but hopefully those two workers are not there when I do."

Lacks sauce and flavor, employees gave us their best seller a pepperoni and mushroom pizza, then we also got a plain pepperoni and 4 cheese. So we tried 3 different slices, lol they were all terrible. My friend blames the cooks I somewhat agree. Another pizza place we try that fails in are book. Service was a 1 for the dirty looks for asking for a plate I must have interrupted a very important conversation between the girl and the cook, and also for being recommended a soggy tasteless pizza. Nothing special here."

It was a chore to attempt to finish, I ended up leaving the plate half full.\nThe pizza was plain, the sauce lacked flavour, not an ounce of spice in sight.\nNot worth the high price tag, highly recommend you skip and find a different Italian restaurant to visit in the bay."

The mussels had an odd flavor that didn't taste very fresh, and the catch of the day tasted very uninspired. Pasta dish was decent but nothing special. Highlight of the meal was definitely the complimentary baguette."

Located in a busy downtown area there was ample parking in the lot across the street in addition to the street.  Indoor and outdoor seating available.  The food is spicy, flavorful and yummy! Each person in our party enjoyed their selection.  Served at the perfect temperature, each entree exploded with flavors.  The oxtails? Divine.  Chef\u2019s kiss.  This is definitely a new favorite."

Everything was delicious, with the standouts being the lamb chops and the antrikot rib eye. While the other dishes were good, they weren't necessarily worth the price.\n\nThe service was attentive, with our table consistently cleaned, water glasses refilled, and frequent check-ins from our server. However, our table's location near a high-traffic area resulted in frequent bumps from rushing servers and other diners. Despite the spaciousness of the restaurant, we were placed in a less than ideal spot. We moved our table ourselves, but the issue persisted.  Despite this, our server was fantastic, and we didn't let it ruin our evening. This was a one-time experience that we enjoyed overall!"

This place is definitely going for the Michelin vibe which is no surprise given the chef's background. The service is impeccable and the ambience is perfect for the laid back yet sophisticated west coast vibe.\n\nKeep in mind the menu changes constantly to highlight what's in season (and due to availability of fresh ingredients). So if you fall in love with something you see online, be prepared for some potentially bad news.\n\nOverall, you can't really go wrong with Ethel if you are looking for more elevated seasonal flavors with a touch of Japanese fusion."

The food here \"Broke The Mouth\" every time, bruddah! We recently had our holiday party here for 75 people max, and it was amazing! Joy coordinated everything with our team, and we highly recommend this restaurant for your event up to 75 people for a buy-out. We had a lunch buy-out. They allowed us to set up a photo booth outside upon entry and had two solo musicians rotating inside to really deliver an amazing company event. You can even book the private room for up to 16 people for smaller events. All of the staff is amazing and always helpful. This is a well oiled machine and I hope to see them anchored in Palo Alto for many more years to come so we can enjoy every new menu item chef creates. We just enjoyed the New Years Eve tasting menu and it did not disappoint. Enjoy the photos!"

They have a label saying how long you can reheat safely. Dog even their plastic bag was sturdy as hell. The chicken leg was incredibly tender and fall off the bone. They don't skimp out on your protein portion. The vegetables were crisp and everything in general was well-flavored. Nothing was any bit close to being too salty. They have a great system going and are constantly pumping out bento boxes which are filling but not decadently so. You would think a place so dedicated to takeout wouldn't keep it's grounds clean but the tables and general area are pristine. Go here."

The portions are generous, it took me two lunches to finish my weekly special. Many things here are self-service and there's additional chili and the likes for your dishes in the middle of the establishment. The toilet was pretty clean. It's nothing revolutionary but they're really good at doing what they're doing. Go here for quick lunch if you're in the area."

The service was amazing and the server intentionally made sure we had enough soup in the larger pot and that the temperature would stay perfect. The food was so delicious! Of course, we probably all over ate... But what a memorable evening! I highly recommend a visit and I hope to return again! I was very impressed with the service. I would give it 6 stars, if I could."

With no indoor tables available, we were seated outside, which was lively but a bit cold, making it less cozy. Parking was a hassle\u2014had to park a few blocks away due to limited spots. The food was the star: I had the Chicken Croffle, a crispy, juicy chicken breast on a flaky croissant waffle, drizzled with spicy honey maple syrup that perfectly balanced sweet and savory. It was beautifully plated and absolutely delicious. My daughter ordered the Matcha Moffle, a vibrant, chewy matcha-infused moffle sitting on a pool of matcha lava, topped with fresh strawberries and a sprinkle of powdered sugar\u2014a stunning, earthy-sweet treat that looked as incredible as it tasted. Service was okay, a bit rushed due to the busy crowd, but our server was friendly. A 20% tip was auto-added for our group of five. If you\u2019re a foodie who loves creative brunch dishes like these, Sweet Maple\u2019s Cupertino spot is a gem. Try visiting on a weekday for a less hectic experience, though you\u2019ll still face tricky parking."

They have a limited (compared to some other places) but a very satisfying menu!\n\nFrom the first interaction to the last the customer service was really good and friendly.\n\nFood was amazing and the presentation was top notch as well.\n\nThey offer a range of egg preparations, burgers and other nice dishes as well. I didn\u2019t tryout any beverages so can not vouch for those but the drinks menu looked pretty decent too\n\nThe food might be on the expensive side a bit but it is worth it. The waiting time can be a bit much depending on the day and time. For us it was just around 10 minutes.\nWould not hesitate to go again!"

I went on a Friday at 6pm and the lot was super full, but with people getting takeout. So if you want to eat inside, no problem!\n\nI tried Proposition Chicken, the burger was super juicy and honestly good size for the price. My friend had one of the SOB Burgers which he also enjoyed, but said could've been a bit bigger.\n\nYou'd have to try all the offerings to get an accurate sense but my ratings are based on the experience I had. Will definitely be back to try more!"

Probably the reason why I\u2019m a little disappointed with the Bay Area locations.\n\nA huge difference I have seen is the size of the tempura especially the shrimp and squid. So much bigger in Hawaii. The shrimp at this location was so small. Smaller than the frozen Costco size.  Also both the shrimp and squid were on the soggy side and didn\u2019t offer much crunch so I would like to try when they are freshly made. Remember price adds up when you add the tempura.\n\nThe Nikutama sauce was great! Worker gave us a little more since they were closing. I appreciate that service from the worker. But there is something different about the combination of free soup and eating hot crunchy tempura in Hawaii.\n\nLocation has lots of seats which is a plus and I like the counter that offers \u2026 water, to go cups, tempura sauce and etc. I\u2019ll still go back but for some freshly made tempura!"

The 2/3 taco platter comes with a side, I picked half and half fries, regular and chile lime option. The chile lime fries were better.\n\n- The dessert was great, wish they\u2019d put the vanilla on top instead of providing as a side option, it\u2019d have been perfect. I skipped the seasonal berry.\n\n- The tables were lil sticky, everything else was great, like the heaters etc. Also, the tipping starts at 18% when you pay, & the kinda waited on the side as we tip, so felt a little pressured to pick that 18%\ud83d\ude0f"

We asked for a couple of dishes to be made vegetarian, and they obliged. There is a line, if you come in during normal lunch and dinner hours. The mushrooms with peppers was excellent, as were the sauteed veggies. The grilled fish, Cambodian style is a must have. The mushroom fried rice was excellent as well. Service is friendly."

Sadly, the authenticity doesn't extend as far as their $24 \"Bangers and Mash\" which arrived with cold mashed potatoes and a tiny plastic pot of gravy on the side. It's certainly nostalgic if you're craving 1980s British school dinners, but that's probably not what you're here for at these prices. Avoid."

A nice place to go to unwind. Great wine selection. Must try the veggie burger or the bacon-wrapped filet! Also, they just put up some festive fall decor \ud83c\udf83"

We waited about 25 minutes for our food, so it might be a good idea to call ahead if you\u2019re in a hurry.\n\nThe clams and crawfish were fresh and live. Head-off shrimp was good as well. The Cap\u2019t Loui seasoning had a nice touch of sweetness and tasted great. The sides exceeded our expectations \u2014 both the Cajun fries and garlic noodles were delicious.\n\nOne thing to note: the price on the wall was for frozen crawfish. The menu didn\u2019t clearly show the price for live crawfish, which ended up being more expensive, so that was a little confusing. Also, the crawfish itself was a bit plain and needed to be dipped in the sauce for more flavor.\n\nOverall, a solid spot for Cajun seafood."

Enchiladas and crab cake meal had soooo much flavor and came out scorching hot for a caferteria type pick up style.  Like the fact I can get my healthy alternatives in. My meal included zucchini and cherry tomatoes, soft and flavorful.   Brown rice was cooked perfectly. The portions were fulfilling.  Couldn't finish the appetizer black bean dip (delicious).  We tried half of the salsa bar sauces, all were delicious. The ghost sauce will creep up on you, oh and the drinks as well. Mai Tai and Carribean slushy premade drinks had a punch with lots of flavor.  Did the job \ud83d\ude4c."

This location is also bigger and the interiors are quite pretty.\n\nWe went there on Saturday afternoon, and although there was a bit of a wait, it was much faster than SF. And there were other stores nearby so were easily able to spend time there. Bonus: Izumi Matcha is just across the street!\n\nComing to the food: we ordered our usual tonkutsu ramen, and it was pretty good. My husband ordered beer and that was amazing!"

I can\u2019t complain the food was/is amazing. This place is an all you can eat of whatever type meal you choose.\n\nSince I knew what I was to experience I decided to have the seafood and salad option. I know I cannot eat all the meat they\u2019ll serve and I would get too full. I\u2019m not saying you shouldn\u2019t though. But the seafood and salad option is the same eat all you.\n\nThe service was great. The people I was with all had meat options and they just kept coming non-stop. They give you a token that when you want to take a break just flip the token and they\u2019ll stop. Pretty cool right?!?\n\nThe ambiance is beautiful. Quite fancy. Good for a date night however it can get very loud. Now the food tastes great and all the meat you can eat is wonderful but in my opinion it\u2019s a bit pricey. This is not a place I would do a big dinner party in."

Their delivery service was non stop and the restaurant was packed at 4pm (which is a bit of a random time in between lunch/dinner) so we knew we were in the right spot.\n\nTheir Pad Thai is very authentic and exactly what I was looking for! Will come back!\n\nThe Papaya Salad is a must! Really fresh and huge plate that works to share.\n\nWe loved that they asked us for the level of desired spiciness on each plate. Be mindful of their spicy levels though as we went with medium and it was more like a \u201chot\u201d. Mild is more like a true \u201cmedium\u201d. Still very delicious as we love spicy foods but if you don\u2019t, tell them zero spicy.\n\nThere\u2019s many Thai restaurants around South Bay Area but not many that are great. This one will be on my repeat list."

They were delicious!  The curry was standard & the chicken fried rice was okay.  Last night ( Friday) they were beyond bustling.  The restaurant was packed, inside & out. There were other Asian cuisines as neighbors but they had most of the business.  The parking lot was at capacity.  People were parking illegally & using their hazards to pick up orders.  The most disappointing thing was that they didn\u2019t have soy sauce & they didn\u2019t give me napkins or cutlery in my to go order.  I\u2019d be tempted to return for egg rolls but it\u2019s not worth hassle. 3/5"

Our server Nicole was so warm and welcoming, she was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and gave great recommendations. We had the garlic feta fries which were AMAZING, along with the Pita Chicken Falafel (which is my personal favorite) and for desert had the chocolate mousse which was a perfect combination of sweet but not over powering sweet. The manager Paloma (I believe her name was) came and checked in on us and was so kind! It was overall an amazing experience and tasty meal. I\u2019m from Washington state here visiting family and every time I come down I always make sure to stop here. 10/10 recommend."

Falafel were crispy and well seasoned but were tiny. Roasted cauliflower was lightly seasoned and still crunchy. Shushuka was hot and spicy with lots of tomato sauce. But, The garlic feta fries were the best dish, to be honest, still crispy and moist topped with garlic and feta. Service was excellent and the ambience was relaxing and well appointed."

But when we arrived, everything looked absolutely wonderful in person. The lighting was perfectly dimmed, and the table settings were immaculate. The staff was highly professional, making the experience even more enjoyable.\n\nAnd of course, the food\u2014this was the best dry-aged steak I\u2019ve ever had. Every other dish we tried was just as impressive.\n\nI can\u2019t wait to come back!"

Right from the ambience to prompt service and attention to detail, the place knocked if out of the park. The wait staff was extremely knowledgeable and accommodating. Great selection of steak and non steak items and customized to vegetarian options.  Pricey, but worth the experience.  The cotton candy at the end was a nice touch."

We ordered Har Gow, Chicken Feet, Sesame Balls, Shanghai XLB, Crab Claws, Chicken Shui Mai, Poached Gailan, BBQ Pork Rice Crepe, and the Pineapple Bun. It looked like we hardly put a dent in the menu too, lots of good items, with some decent vegetarian options as well. All of it was excellent and I would recommend these items to my friends. The staff were friendly and welcoming and quick too! I was not expecting that. Henry was our server and he packaged up some of our left overs for us and gave us a complimentary pudding dessert.\n\nThe atmosphere was calm and well lit. Lots of space! They also have WiFi. I can say for sure that we will be coming back."

It has a nice ambiance and while not being a large venue has decent wait times, with the option to join the wait-list via Yelp.\nThe food is pretty tasty with a nice variety of dumplings and pot stickers. My favorites are the pan-fried pork dumplings and sweet and sour cucumber.\nThe only downsides here are the phone menu ordering in a building with bad reception and weak WiFi. It's taken me 10 minutes sometimes to get the page to load and be able to start placing orders. The staff is fairly attentive, but maybe due to the digital ordering system it feels like something is maybe missing from the sit down experience.\nOverall a good find and we've visited a few times already, also the pricing is really good. I fed a family of 6 without holding back and we all left full for under $200. There's something that can't be understated about leaving with both a happy stomach and a happy wallet!"

You order online and they serve you but you cant cash out online, only with your wairess. The staff brought the food but no one checked on us until i flagged one of them down for my check\n\nThe food itself was middle of the road. The dumplings popped easy and soup got everywhere.  The potstickers had added batter that waffled out from the potstickers ( see photo) but were fresh and delicious.\n\nI may go back because the prices were good but honestly there are much better dumpling spots."

We tried the sashimi salad, hamachi (yellowtail) carpaccio, and salmon clay pot rice. While all were fantastic, the hamachi carpaccio was particularly delicate, flavorful, and beautifully balanced. The service was also very good, attentive without being intrusive, which made the experience even more enjoyable. We\u2019ll definitely be back to explore more of the menu!"

We came as party of 4 adult, and the set for 4 people (Yakiniku Party) is perfect for us!"

The vegan pork belly is good.\n\nThe wonton noodle soup is so-so -- broth is blandish and the wonton has a dime sized filling. Go for the other soups. The beef noodle soup is quite flavorful.\n\nFor the noodle dishes, you can request for fresh/hand-pulled noodles.\n\nFor vegetarians and vegans, they have plenty of options. They even indicate in no meat dishes that lard/pork fat is used.\n\nDownside is it's pricey."

But none were weak, save the chicken malai soft shell quesadilla. The biryani are a great take on a classic disk. The drinks are presented well. I think the star of the show was the dessert. Everyone at the table adored the tutta futta paan for dessert. It has a wide-range of flavors with a good balance between aroma and sweetness. The rasmalai tres leaches was light, airy, and sweet. The place is kept clean and the service is alright but can be exceedingly lacking at times for a restaurant of this price point and with these goals in mind of tapas."

The noodles were also cut into short 2in pieces for some reason.\n\nThere's a 5% extra charge added to every bill, for the waiters. The suggested tip starts from 18% which is wild for the horrendous food quality."

When they are busy, you have to put your name, and they will call you to be seated.\nYou ordered the side dishes  at the counter, and they will bring it to your table. There are plenty of items to choose from. If I am not mistaken, one plate is about $10. The food is good.  Lunch time you can order a plate with 3 side dishes.  After 8 pm, they also have 20% off the dishes."

The dish I received was served in a hot iron skillet, which kept the food warm throughout my meal. The centerpiece was a mound of perfectly cooked white rice, topped with a creamy sauce, fresh green onions, sweet corn kernels, and a spicy condiment that added a delightful kick. Surrounding the rice were thin slices of beef that continued to cook on the hot skillet, ensuring each bite was tender and flavorful. The combination of textures and flavors was exceptional, and the sizzling presentation added an exciting element to the dining experience. Overall, Sizzling Lunch provided a delicious and memorable meal that I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a unique and satisfying dining experience."

While the fish was a little bland for my taste, the texture made up for it.\n\nThe calamari was very flavorful, though it did have a bit more breading than I prefer. Still, the seasoning made up for it, but I would have loved to taste more of the calamari itself. The fries that came with fish & chips were the only letdown, not quite up to par, but they didn\u2019t detract too much from the overall experience. I'd definitely return!"

Can be enough for two, but I would recommend to get your own. The crispy rice with tuna is delicious - a bit of hot sauce can embellish the flavor if you dare! We tried the ramen with chicken broth but replace with tofu. It was good, but I still think the vegetarian ramen is better, IMHO. Edamame was ok, it had lemon or lime squirted in it - wasn\u2019t my cup of tea, but my wife loves lemon, so a win for her. There is a 16% surcharge FYI. I would come back to try the crispy garlic chicken."

The fish slices are very soft and the soup is a bit sour because the pickled cabbage, good to eaten with white rice.\n\nService is fast and friendly , but table so small and tiny .\n\nPrice is very reasonable, 2 people $38 , one appetizer - deep fried chicken , 2 drink , one pot of fish ."

They have varying levels of spice for different palates, but the single chili pepper soup was just right for us.

Chicken is so tender (probably most tender chicken without too much grease) and the spicy sauce makes the chicken more tasty (real spicy that you can feel). Note the sauces are on the side (2 spicy sauce cups and 2 non spicy sauces) and you can control the spicy level by yourself. The sauce is so great that even the cucumbers and peanuts inside are tasty.\n\nAlso got some other braised food and they are vacuum packed and in the refrigerator which makes the food much safer, especially in the summer. See one of the pictures that shows the refrigerator. I haven\u2019t tried them yet,  will update later. Update: they are super spicy, much spicier than the red oil chicken.\n\nThere\u2019s more food I\u2019d like to try in this place, such as Cold noodles and Liangpi\uff08\u51c9\u76ae), braised beef shank\uff08\u5364\u725b\u8171\uff09and braised pork hock, bell shaped dumplings \uff08\u949f\u6c34\u997a). Both pork hock and bell shaped dumplings are sold out this time.\n\nThe only complaint I have is about the parking place. Street parking available but limited, there\u2019s a bit parking lot nearby but it was not designed for the store, not sure if I should park there."

We had Ribeye and Kobe beef combo, with house special and sukiyaki broth. They pair very well. I especially loved the sesame sauce, so special and tasty - it made the meat and vegetables taste even better! We felt the quality of food from this restaurant in every dish they offered. We will definitely come back. Highly recommend!"

It\u2019s a small, intimate spot, with lighting that keeps the focus on what matters\u2014the food!\n\n\ud83c\udf72 Broths & Proteins\n\nWe ordered:\n\nHouse Special Broth (Miso/Soymilk) \u2013 my pick\n\nGarlic Miso Broth \u2013 my girlfriend\u2019s choice\n\nBoth were flavorful and well-balanced. For meats, we had Kubota Pork Belly and American Kobe Beef, both top-tier in quality. Even the standard cuts were incredibly tender.\n\nEach meal includes a generous veggie box \ud83e\udd66 and a choice of rice or noodles. I chose clear noodles (harusame), while she went with rice.\n\n\u262f\ufe0f The \"One Pot\" Twist\n\nInstead of individual pots, they serve the broth yin-yang style, letting you share and swap flavors. Plus, there\u2019s a temperature control knob so you\u2019re not stuck with boiling-hot broth the entire time.\n\n\ud83e\udd5c Dipping Sauces\n\nThey provide sesame sauce and ponzu sauce\u2014mix and match to find your favorite combo. I liked a bit of both!\n\n\u2b50 Final Thoughts\n\nOne Pot Shabu Shabu stands out with high-quality meats, flavorful broths, and thoughtful details. Whether you're a hot pot pro or a first-timer, this place is a must-try. We\u2019ll definitely be back\u2014maybe for the premium cuts next time! \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udd25"

They\u2019re from Hunan and so is my family, so I had high expectations which were let down.\n\nFor protein, we got a duck, frog, and tofu dish. They all had the same flavor profile\u2014salty and oily\u2014and way too much filler, not enough protein. The frog dish probably only had one frog. The only dish we completely finished was the hot and spicy shredded potato. The dishes also came out really slowly, maybe 15 minutes between each one, to the point we thought they had forgotten.\n\nPatron bathroom was also out of order when we went, so you had to use the inside employee restroom.\n\nBench seating has this built-in wall, making it a bit awkward if you have a belly or are less mobile.\n\nSmall parking lot but plenty of street parking around. No wait on a Sunday night."

The restaurant owner is super friendly, and the ambience is just great. I would definitely bring friends and coworkers here again."

We ordered\nPork Sausage Rolls\nGrilled Pork Rolls\nSauteed Flank Steak Pho\n\nWe found it interesting that our starters came later after our Pho was served; perhaps we waited another 5 minutes. Wouldn't it be great to have the appetizers before our main dish? We felt it was fast moving chain of restaurant, it was great that our Pho came quickly but it wasn't hot - more of warm Pho. We enjoyed the rolls and the flavor of the Pho despite only having it warm.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed the dishes that we ordered and were happy."

Went back to the car so we can get seated bec the waiting area indoors is full, and it's raining outside. After 25 mins, we got a call on my phone that our table was ready.  Went in and got seated immediately.\n\nWe were escorted to our table.  It was empty except for the paper cover and the menus.  When we got seated, another person brought the utnesils and glases of water.  We were told to call her when ready.\n\nWe ordered one beef Pho to share with my wife and one appetizer plus 2 appetizers to-go.  We were told there is a surcharge of 18% for dining in, so we will be charged separately for the to-go order - it makes sense, no problem.\n\nIt only took maybe 2 mins, and our hot Pho order arrived with one extra bowl so we can share. That was quick, considering the place is busy with a long queue.  Then, after 5 min, the crab appetizer came.\n\nThe Pho was really good.  It's not salty and tasted better than our favorite Pho place.  It came in a larger bowl, so immediately, we can say that we made the right decision to share it.  The beef peices are in cubes and they're cooked well and easy to chew and eat.  However, it didn't come with a lot of meat - or could be bec they're in thick cubes, instead of several thin slices.\n\nMy wife's favorite was the crab appetizer.  I liked it too, but I liked the Pho better.\n\nOur to-go order were Pork Egg rolls and Goi Cuon.  I avoid reviewing to-go orders if we don't immediately eat them as soon as we get home, so I will not comment on these unless they are exceptionally still good even hours later."

It was a solid dish. We also added a side green salad for some fiber and greens."

Most of the items here are meant to be eaten cold or heat it up at the comfort of your home. You can walk in, grab what is in the fridge, pay, and leave.\n\nThe owner is very nice and answered all my questions since it is my first time here.  Support your local small businesses!\n\nFood: I picked Dan Dan Noodles, Beef Combo, Green Bean Jelly, and Pork Intestines (for my hot pot \ud83e\udd24). You can see the pork intestines are cleaned very well and filled with fat.  Most items are priced between $8 -$12 and good portion sizes.  I got all 4 dishes under $45 with tax.\n\nThey also have homemade beef jerky from sweet to spicy and other delicious looking food I haven't explore. I definitely will come back and give it a try!"

You can tell the ingredients are fresh and food is prepared carefully with heart. The food is in high quality and the price is very reasonable with its large portion. I\u2019m surprised that such a fantastic restaurant is hidden in a small plaza. Will definitely come back again."

We had four of their house specialties: Gindara Kasuzuke (broiled Alaskan black cod marinated in sake and miso), Chaean Mushi (steamed egg custard loaded with yummy umami proteins and veggies), Shimeji Mushroom Saute, and Kinpira Gobo (sauteed burdock root). These dishes are all worthy of your time and attention - all bursting with umami and delicately balanced in flavors. We also had one of the best Yakitori we have ever had. They served a generous portion of Ohitashi, a personal favorite. Finally, the saki and hamachi nigiri sushi they served were delicately delicious and perfect. Azuma is truly a gem! Highly recommended \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc"

We got there on a Sunday afternoon, it wasn\u2019t too busy and we got seated right away and had easy access to their menu using the QR code on the table. Ordering was super easy and food started coming out within 5-10 minutes.\n\n\u849c\u9999\u56db\u5b63\u8c46 Stir-fried Garlic Flavored String Beans *Rating: 10/10* - Absolute fire!! You can\u2019t go wrong with this dish in general and this place made it to perfection. I would\u2019ve eaten all of it if I wasn\u2019t so full.\n\n\u725b\u8089\u5377\u997c Beef Roll *Rating: 10/10* - Girllll I\u2019ve never eaten anything like this before it was so delicious. I was skeptical about the cucumber at first, but the beef, the cucumber, the wrap\u2013 all of it together was heaven! I wish I could\u2019ve ordered more of this.\n\n\u9e21\u84c9\u7389\u7c73\u7fb9 Chicken & Cream Corn Chowder/Soup *Rating: 10/10*- I love me some soup, so when I saw this on the menu I begged my friend to order it for us. It was so delicious and soothed my throat. I saved some for the next day and enjoyed it one more time.\n\n\u87f9\u7c89\u5c0f\u7b3c\u5305 Crab Roe Soup Dumplings (XLB) *Rating: 10/10* - This was some standard crab roe soup dumplings, delicious and didn\u2019t come out TOO hot like they usually do. I was a little sad that two came with the soup spilling out already but it was enjoyable otherwise.\u2028\u2028\u751f\u714e\u5305 Pan-fried Buns *Rating: 10/10* - Loveeed these pan-fried buns. It was the perfect combination of crispy and the typical dumpling texture. The meat inside was savory and could give me a heart attack that\u2019s how fire it was.\n\n\u8471\u6cb9\u62cc\u9762 Scallion-Oil Mixed Noodles *Rating: 8/10* - I liked these in general and they were good, but lacking a specific flavor I was personally looking for.  Still ate it up though!\n\n\u7cd6\u918b\u5c0f\u6392 Shanghai Style Sweet and Sour Pork Ribs *Rating: 8/10* -  Okay before I say anything this is one of the new items I tried for the first time and they were good but I wouldn\u2019t order it for myself. I\u2019m glad my friend shared this with me. It is indeed sweet and sour.\n\n\u7ea2\u70e7\u72ee\u5b50\u5934 Braised Pork Meatballs *Rating: 8/10* - This was pretty good but I also would not order this for myself personally. I think if the rice we got on the side was more fresh I would\u2019ve enjoyed eating it with the meatballs more.\n\n\u7ea2\u70e7\u8089\u9e4c\u9e51\u86cb Braised Pork Belly and Quail Eggs *Rating: 6.5/10* - I was really excited that we decided to order this one but once we got it, the flavor profile did not match what I was expecting is all. It was still good, the meat was delicious but it did have like a\u2026 ginger/cinnamon flavor to it that I wasn\u2019t a fan of? Oh loved the quail eggs though."

Pickled cucumber appetizer, shrimp fried rice, braised beef shank and tendon noodle soup, fried pork chop, stir-fried vegetables and a four seasons green tea for two. All 5/5. We also added more appetizers. Fried fish cake and squid balls. If you are into Taiwanese food, check this place  out."

The ramen flavors were some of the best I\u2019ve had\u2014rich, flavorful, and satisfying! The interior decor was really nice and added to the dining experience.\n\nThe service was excellent; the servers were kind, and everything was served quickly, which was great. However, I did find the portions a bit small\u2014my ramen felt like half a bowl. For the price, which is on the higher side, a bit more quantity would make it perfect.\n\nThe parking could be an issue if you are looking to park in the complex, however there\u2019s a multi level parking garage besides as well.\n\nOverall, great flavors and atmosphere, just wish the portions matched the price!"

        "comment": "To me, the best dish was the vegetable tofu in brown sauce, because it was flavorful enough to enjoy various kinds of flavors. The establishment is clearly a Chinese restaurant that many would visit on a random basis, as it is located amongst a lot of stores that have Chinese on their titles or related to Chinese culture in an outlet format in Cupertino.\n\nI thought the Kung Pao Chicken was pretty standard and was good enough to make myself full. The black mushroom with vegetables was unfortunately below my expectations as the mushrooms had strong flavor while the vegetables didn't have any, causing a flavor imbalance, while the dish itself didn't have enough juice or broth to allow some mushroom umami flavor to flavor up the vegetables. The sesame bread with green onion was pretty thick and I mostly used it to accompany my dishes instead of rice, and since it was flavorless itself, it worked out fine. However, if one was expecting it to taste like the scallion pancakes that are popular in China, then one could be disappointed.\n\nSince there were other Chinese restaurants around the area, if I make it around the area again, I would most likely try another spot instead."

I felt we got ripped off because it's on the menu but they wouldn't honor it for whatever reason.\n\n\u571f\u8c46 - is a local dish.  Vinegar stir fry potatoes.  It's ok. Acquired taste.\n\n\u9178\u83dc\u7c89\u7d72 - Actually not bad, sour but I enjoyed it.\n\n\u5927\u76e4\u96de - My favorite dish. The chicken and potatoes was flavorful.  The noodle was too soggy but taste good with the sauce.\n\nPeking duck - It's actually very good.  Some of the skins were so crunchy it almost melt in your mouth but they're are other pieces more tough and the meat is a bit overcooked.\n\nSweet and sour pork - the batter was crunchy when it first came out.  Then get soggy.  It's not bad.\n\nKung Pao chicken - Good flavor, not bad.\n\nTofu - pretty plain. Sauce on the salty side.\n\nI've to say I was disappointed when they couldn't give us the 1.5 duck. I assume they have a legitimate reason.   However, after a few dishes, I was pretty satisfied for the food is pretty good.  It's a Peking home style cooking.\n\nOne interesting aspect... No tips required."

I felt imperial treasure is way overpriced and Beijing Duck House is closed on Tuesday so I came here.\n\nBut honestly I'm pleasantly surprised at how delicious some of the food has become. Maybe they improved their cooking but I decided to give them 4 stars instead of the typical 3 I would have given for food before.\n\nThe missing one star has a lot to do with how long it took for us to get our food. Maybe it's because they were busy but we wait over an hour for our food including the duck that we pre-ordered.\n\nOtherwise I think their duck is really good deal because they gives you a lot of sauce and the wraps so you don't necessarily have to order extra wraps like other places do.\n\nThe other dishes are not bad either especially the boiling fish because it's really delicious. Even the cauliflower was well made. I think this place definitely deserves coming back more often because the quility of cooking went up.\n\nThe service can be slow because they are so busy and I like the availability of those semi private spaces."

Arrived at 11:45am because the place doesn't open until 11:30 am on Sunday and it was very easy for us to find parking. I've been to the Milpitas location and wanted to give this one a try since it's the same restaurant and I like it since it's a build your own noodle bowl and you even get to choose the broth base. I went with the tom yum soup base and it was delicious. I will also say that this location didn't seem to have a bottle of mala spice which I was a bit disappointed in.\n\nThe seating arrangement of the store has the tables really close to each other in the restaurant."

My little one was being super fussy and the manager was so accommodating and understanding trying to console him as well and trying to give suggestions but he was super sleepy and wasn't having it but we really appreciated her support. Will definitely plan better and return. The braised pork was my favorite."

We were at another restaurant across the street but realized it was the wrong place. It felt so cold and dark there. So we left and ended up at XLB Kitchen, a hole in the wall, and it was the best thing ever. The place is small but has an outdoor area. The vibe was very local Chinese\u2014a Chinese grandpa was eating at a table next to me, reading his newspaper. Love it!\n\nThe hostess greeted us at the door and immediately gave us menus and tea. The menu is simple yet it had all the classic Chinese dishes. We ordered XLB, shanghai style rice cakes, and string beans. ALL DELICIOUS.\n\nThe XLB were HUGE! Thin skin yet SO juicy. Dare I say, better than Din Tai Fung!? The plate of rice cake was a pleasant surprise too. Very tasty, not too oily, included veggies too. The string beans were a classic, maybe a little pricey.\n\nOverall, we cleaned everything off our plates and left with full stomachs and smiles. We will be back!!"

The kitchen was closing, and I think the bar closed at 9:30 so there was really only time for one drink at our pace. Seemed strange to close that early for a weekend night on Castro Street. Besides that the service was okay, and the drinks were pretty good. I really liked the atmosphere."

We also had the wings. My friend has the burger and fries, which to me was the best tasting plate from the table. Service was great. It's a bar atmosphere, so a bit noisy inside and if you sit closer to the outside, you have to regular street noise. There is outdoor seating if you prefer that.

We ordered a deep fried seafood (JALEA), a half rotisserie chicken, and a seafood paella (ARROZ CON MARISCOS) - The deep fried seafood tasted good and not too oily. The chicken thigh and drumstick were also delicious, but the breast was a bit too dry; The paella (they don't call it as such by the way) was good too, the portion isn't as big as you would see at other restaurant, but I would say it is enough for 2 - 4 adults if you intend to share all dishes.\n\nWe could find better taste of each individual dishes elsewhere, but to find them all in one restaurant is probably not that easy. All 3 dishes plus 2 drinks came in total $99+tax+gratuity, which isn't cheap for 2 people. We could've just ordered 2 dishes instead, but we thought we gave it a good try. Overall, the food is considered good, it is a solid 4 stars, but I won't give it 5 stars.\n\nThe waiter was super nice and friendly, the service should deserve 5 stars!! This restaurant is quite popular in the area, we were there without reservation, so we were given the choice of either at the bar or outdoor dining spot.\n\nIn summary, we have not yet found a good reason we would come back again any time soon. if we do, we probably would try out some other dishes and the seafood paella is probably the one we would order again.!!"

The restaurant leans slightly upscale, thanks to its nice ambiance and well-prepared dishes.\n\nWe started with the grilled crispy octopus, which was cooked perfectly to the tenderness I prefer. The fried calamari with spicy dipping sauce was a great addition, especially when paired with a few glasses of wine. The classic burrata cheese with plenty of tomatoes was hearty, and I particularly enjoyed the soft, creamy texture of the burrata. The ahi tuna tartare, loaded with pickled vegetables, had a nice balance of flavors.\n\nFor my main course, I had the seafood fettuccine, which rounded out a satisfying meal. We finished with a trio of desserts\u2014tiramisu, lava cake, and cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e\u2014bringing our lovely dinner to a sweet close. The service was great, though they did push high-end options like wine, liquor, and premium dishes. Just be mindful and check the prices before ordering."

It looked aesthetic, and it was crowded (actually full).\n\nWe ordered:\n1. Bruschette Assortite - This was the best dish amongst all our orders. There were 3- pesto cheese, mushroom, and one with tomato. All of them were great! I think $15 for this one still made sense.\n2. App Gnocchi Gratinati - Super mediocre. Tasted kind of weird, and was pretty much a waste of $16.\n3. Ravioli Zucca - Extremely oily. The gravy was mostly oil with some nuts and a couple of leaves. The nuts and leaves gave a nice flavor, but it couldn't cut it. Salt was less and it didn't justify a price of $28. This was actually our server's top recommendation.\n4. Pizza Margherita - this was really underwhelming. $20.\n5. Kick in Old Fashioned - My partner liked this drink, I liked it too. $15\n\nThe service wasn't great either. It took a long time and it is not the server's fault, but none of the suggestions worked great for us. Given the price point, I wouldn't recommend this place that much. I highly recommend going at a time when they have some happy hour/ offers for the try. I did read some people mentioning about it in reviews.\n\nThe server offered me a taste of a cocktail but never came back with it, maybe I was confused. But then I just skipped ordering one altogether.\n\nOverall, it was a good experience--nothing fancy coz food wasn't top notch, but we loved the ambiance. We enjoyed our nice date night and made a memory for the next two weeks we were gonna live away!"

But when you dine in at the restaurant, that\u2019s not the case\u2014the food is served quickly, and the seafood is extremely fresh.\n\nWe\u2019ve been here countless times, from casual evenings to birthday celebrations. I love how this place strikes the perfect balance between casual and fancy, making it great for any occasion. The ambiance is warm and inviting, and the service is always attentive, which adds to the overall experience. It\u2019s definitely a spot we keep coming back to!

We had the Sashimi trio and Japanese Wasabi original Ahi Poke bowl.\nLatest update:\nWe've eaten here a couple of more times since my original review, and we were lucky that Shauna was our bartender! She's excellent and we have fun talking to her. We've had the sesame green beans and the Hawaiian Ahi Poke bowl, and both were very tasty. Yesterday, besides cocktails and wine we had the Guaca Poke followed by the Kanpachi and the East Coast Lobster roll, and both were so \"Ono\" For dessert we had the Macadamia nut gelato."

It came with a sweet chili crisp that wasn't too spicy and added a ton of flavor\n\nBad:\n- Super busy, when we left it was a 20 min wait time so we're lucky we came early enough!\n\nOverall would come again, super cute ambiance and vibe."

On a lovely sunny day, we can sit outside and people watch while you enjoy your coffee. The selection was quite good, and everything looked very delicious, although a bit pricey. I settled with an almond croissant, which was very well done. I also got an iced latte, which again was a little bit expensive, but again very well made. Had it been a little more economical? I would have given this place a five star. Nevertheless, it\u2019s a good choice if you want some pastries and coffee."

They taste good as well and are primarily mousse based which some people may prefer. The price is a bit steep, but you can see the quality and craftsmanship in their desserts so I don't think it's too expensive for what they sell.\n\nStaff is helpful but has spilled several of our drinks when serving them at the table. The seating area is often full and crowded and can't accommodate large groups, but you could also try to sit outdoors. The indoor dining also is a bit messy as people are constantly coming in and out.\n\nIt's a classic spot for a hot drink and a dessert, and I definitely frequent Alexander's when I'm in the area!"

Hummus was good, but not like most restaurant hummus. it was more fatty and sour than creamy (if blended for longer, would have been more creamy) so it was good w rice instead of pita.\n\nChicken texture wasn't super tender but all food was hot and fresh.\n\nEach plate came with 2 pieces of pita\n\nAmbiance was fine, price was good for what you get esp for this area. Would come back."

It's on Castro between Church and High School streets.  There is street parking and an underground lot behind the Wells Fargo shared with St. Joseph Church.  There is an order counter with a menu board above.  I ordered the Lamb Kebab, medium rare, plate with Hummus and Garlic Potatoes.  I was given a number stand to place at my table and waited a short time for my meal to be delivered along with 4 quarters of Pita bread and Tzatziki sauce.  It's a clean table and chair interior for about 30 people.  There is dining outside also.\n\nMy four large lamb cubes were mostly medium rare, lightly salted and with Mediterranean spices.  The long grain rice was very good, soft and moist.  The Hummus had good lemon and Tahini flavor and the garlic potatoes were soft and mildly flavored.  The Pita bread was warm and soft.\n\nEverything was delicious, quality was very good and quantity also, I took most of the bread and Hummus home. Service was prompt and helpful.  Definitely repeatable.  Your clothes and hair will acquire the grilled meat odors, the grill and dining area are not separated, be warned."

The outdoor seating looked rustic and inviting but it was a cold night and although they have heaters, I didn\u2019t want to brave it.\nWe ordered off the vegetarian options on the menu.\nWe started with the minestrone soup and although it has chicken broth,  we were ok with that. The bread on the house was soft and delicious! But the soup was quite lacking in flavor.\n\nWe ordered a vegetable pizza and the fettuccine Alfredo. The vegetables on the pizza were like semi baked (zucchini) and the tomato slices on top were placed as garnish, which is a slightly different concept for me, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m a fan. It also lacked quite a bit in flavor IMO and tasted quite bland.\nThe pasta was ok; nothing to write home about.\nThe service was good and staff was pleasant but the food unfortunately was a little disappointing. Again this is the vegetarian part of the menu and that may be the reason"

It comes with delicious subtle garlic butter and fresh sourdough. I got the chicken parmigiana. It was a large platter of breaded chicken, spaghetti with marinara sauce, and garlic spinach. The chicken was insanely tasty with melted mozzarella and fresh tomatoes on top. It was well breaded and extremely tender on the inside. They did not skimp on the chicken at all with 2 big cutlets of it. The spaghetti also tasted extremely fresh with marinara sauce. The garlic spinach was very oily though, but it did have a subtle garlic flavor. I didn\u2019t like the spinach as much. The portions were extremely large and I got 2 meals from it!\n\nOVERALL, Giorgio\u2019s was a delicious spot with decent service and great ambiance. The dishes were quite affordable for its large portions. I definitely recommend Giorgio\u2019s to others, especially those who come in large parties."

The beef was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and I couldn\u2019t have been happier! \ud83e\udd24\ud83e\udd62\n\nI walked in during lunchtime and found plenty of seating, but since I was dining solo, I was seated at the front when I actually wanted a bigger booth. \ud83d\ude05 The place filled up quickly, creating a lively atmosphere with nice background music. \ud83c\udfb6\n\nGreat service and absolutely delicious food!

The noodles are awesome and the dumplings are great!\n\nThe service is pretty fast as well, but overall it\u2019s a pretty chill spot.\n\nHad dinner there and got both the noodles and dumpling, which came out hot and delicious. After that we also had the custard buns which were alright. I especially liked the tomato egg noodles out of everything we got.\n\nIt\u2019s got yummy food and tasty dumplings, what more can you ask for? dipping them in the vinegar and chilli oil makes it even tastier though."

It was cooked just right and came with vegetable and mashed potatoes.  The whole dish was absolutely amazing.\n\nThe night ended with a chocolate cake - very tasty and what an awesome presentation.\n\nThe staff was very nice and very attentive - what a customer experience !!!"

Portions have a good size, not too giant but big enough.\nThe place was also decorated with Christmas things, all looking great.\nRestrooms are clean.\nOverall a great experience."

I've visited it 3 times already and will be coming back many many more times.\n\nEvery time we walk in, there is always at least one table available as they have pretty of seats indoors and also outdoors. You walk in & order at the front desk, pay there, and thne you just wait for your food to be delivered to your table. Which happens very fast, their cooks are spectacular!\n\nNow for the food... it's perfect. Never once have I nor anyone that aent there with me, had something wrong with the order. Everything I've ever eaten there was amazing, be that a breakfast food, the crepes, a sandwich, the best is the fries.\n\nI'll definitely be ordering more new things from the menu.\n\nIt's also pet friendly! It's very nice to see so many dogs there :)"

Nothing groundbreaking, but everything tasted good, including the basics like the olive oil and garlic.\n* Menu: great choice for full course (4 mains, 2 desserts).\n* Service: Staff was a definite plus \u2013 friendly and attentive.\n* Atmosphere: Sounds like it's party-friendly.\n\n* Overall: A reliable choice, especially for group gatherings. Not a culinary revelation, but you'll get a good meal and good service."

The Pesto Gnocchi was another highlight\u2014light, pillowy gnocchi coated in a flavorful pesto sauce.\n\nThe ambiance was cozy and inviting, making it a great spot for a relaxed evening. Service was warm and attentive, though the food took a little longer than expected. That said, the quality made up for it!\n\nOverall, a great Italian dining experience. Would definitely come back to try more dishes!"

As someone who recently moved from NYC, which has a lot of amazing Indian restaurants, this place has quickly become a top choice, hands down.\n\nEverything I've had here has been solid. The staff and owner are very attentive and prices are very reasonable for the area.\n\nA note for the spice junkies, \"spicy\" won't have you sweating, but it is a perfect amount of kick and flavor."

Four snaps in a Z-formation for this flavorful feast that had me living my best curry fantasy, hunty!\n\nThat Chicken 65 Biryani was serving BODY-ODY-ODY with its perfectly cooked rice and that chicken giving me all the seasoned drama I needed! Was it spicier than the backstage tea at a pageant? Absolutely! But mama didn't raise no seasoning-shy queen!\n\nThe Butter Chicken? DIVINE! Creamy, luxurious, and richer than my ex's new boyfriend. That sauce was so velvety I wanted to sew it into a gown and werk the runway!\n\nNow the Palak Aloo threw some green realness that had me saying \"Yes, spinach! Work that potato! Serve that nutrition!\" It was giving healthy goddess while still bringing the flavor dance party!\n\nThat garlic naan? STUN-NING! Freshly baked, glistening with buttery goodness like my highlighter after a good setting spray. Though I had to get all diva and remind them I ordered it \u2013 don't make a queen wait for her carbs, darling!\n\nThe service? Well... let's just say it was more chaotic than my first time in five-inch platforms. A bit of confusion on the dance floor, if you know what I mean. Menus after ordering? A chai I didn't ask for? My Mango Lassi playing hide and seek? The drama!\n\nFour stars, my lovelies! The flavors were IT, but the service needs a little choreography lesson. Might stick to takeout next time \u2013 this queen can't handle another encore of \"where's my naan?\"\n\nXOXO,\nMother Masala \ud83d\udc8b"

The beignet came out first, it was airy bit not bready enough but the powdered sugar and chocolate spread made it tasty. The burrito was chicken and quite filling with rice, beans, lettuce and a side of chips with two salsas. The crepe was good with the banana and strawberry with whipped cream on the side. Service was nice, you eat outside with a couple of tables. We have seen this food truck, French and Mexican for awhile and we were curious. Next time, probably try their tacos or creme brulee."

The lamb gosht is also quite nice if you\u2019re a fan of lamb. The rice was very fragrant and paired well with the curries. This meal was very great. We could not help wonder if the experience would have been better with in person dining. All orders are made online or via their QR code online. There is no in store seating, it's all pick up orders in to-go containers and paper plates. There is some seating outside and under a nearby tent but the experience is largely informal. Parking here is adequate, there are enough spaces to handle the lunch rush of customers."

We had the babaganoush, lamb moussaka and chicken, all delicious. The moussaka was loaded with meat, the chicken was tender - just a nice experience. Waiter was friendly, helpful and attentive. Recommended."

This time, I went for the octopus appetizer and my friend had the chicken kebab. They gave us two servings of the house pita, and we also had the kunefe for dessert. Everything was delicious. Will definitely go again to try other things on the menu. Staff is friendly and service is timely."

The buffet tables had an impressive variety, and everything was fresh and well-stocked. In addition to the usual hotpot ingredients, they even offered a solid selection of hot food items: the fried rice was very good, the chicken katsu was juicy, and the steamed buns, spring rolls, and sesame balls were all tasty and satisfying.\n\nWhat really sets this place apart is the thoughtful extras: complimentary boba tea and fresh-churned Turkish-style ice cream were a fantastic bonus. Plus, there\u2019s no time limit for the all-you-can-eat experience, which is a rare and welcome policy. It gave us the chance to enjoy our meal without feeling rushed, especially since it takes a little while for the hotpot broth to come to a boil.\n\nThe only downside was that some of the stoves weren\u2019t working properly. One of our hotpots never boiled, and we had to switch tables mid-meal, which was a bit inconvenient. Hopefully, that gets resolved soon.\n\nStill, overall a great spot for AYCE hotpot with excellent variety, fresh ingredients, and a relaxed atmosphere. Will definitely be back!"

Unfortunately they had black olives, not green ones which are much tastier with the pickles. Order a combo of small plates and appetizers 2 for $12 or 3 for $15. The rice bowl with veggies was good, however I would prefer more mushrooms on it. We liked that they substituted the pita with cut veggies for the hummus dip. Our server was very nice and helpful, chatty and polite."

Typically I only get saut\u00e9ed peppers and onions with my fajitas in San Antonio but these came with peppers, onions, mushrooms, carrots, broccoli, and some zucchini! Excellent!\nThe chicken was cooked perfectly and the tortillas were really good too.\nTheir free chips and salsa were also very fresh and crispy.\nI started with a prickly pear margarita then tried the raspberry margarita and they're both really good also.  Only $12!!\nVery happy with this place and I'll probably come back tomorrow night during my visit to the area \ud83d\ude06\nThey also have a huge selection of tequilas and other liquors with a very friendly and attentive staff."

I ordered a Beef/Lamb Gyro from the menu board at the order counter and paid cash.  I gave my name and my gyro was brought to my table shortly.  The interior is a clean bench and table setup with contemporary diner furniture.  There is a large city free parking structure behind the restaurant.\n\nMy gyro was hefty with the meat slices, french fries, tomato, red onion and tzatziki sauce wrapped with a soft and thick pita.  The meat slices and fries were very noticeably salty although the overall flavor was good.\n\nI thought it was a good value but it was way too salty for me so no repeat."

The combination of ingredients is consistently flavorful and delicious, and the value can't be beat (when it comes to eating out, anyway). Interior is clean and decently spacious."

Not only was the ambiance a beautiful, intimate atmosphere, but the staff and chefs exuded this wonderful, fun energy that made the dining experience that much more fun. The food itself was so delicious and so well thought out. From the conversation and observation of the chef's work, you can tell that each step is well thought out and intentional. Thinking about it now makes my mouth water - can't wait to come back again!!\n\n10/10 would recommend for yall to stop by and experience this for yourself!"

So refreshing and not overly sweet.\nFor lunch I had ordered a Falafel wrap. It was so tasty and light. It was made with fresh ingredients and came quickly.

        "comment": "New Small Plate Options: Affordable and Convenient for All!\n\nContent:\nI recently visited 3 Kingdoms Hot Pot with three friends\u2014four grown men in total\u2014and we were all impressed by their newly introduced \u201csmall plate\u201d options. It\u2019s a thoughtful and budget-friendly addition that worked perfectly for us!\n\nWith this new menu, the average per-person spending is now between $30 -$50 making it an excellent choice for casual gatherings, whether you\u2019re dining solo or in a group. The small plates are especially ideal for lighter eaters or those looking to try more dishes without breaking the bank. Even with four of us, we were able to order a variety of dishes to share, and the portions were just right\u2014plenty to enjoy without any waste.\n\nThis change not only adds flexibility to the dining experience but also makes it more accessible for everyone to enjoy delicious meals at great value. If you\u2019re looking for a spot that offers both quality and affordability, I highly recommend checking out their small plates. Whether you\u2019re dining alone or with friends, you\u2019ll love this convenient and satisfying option!"

The small ingredients are rich, and the watermelon sesame balls can fill you up. This time I also got two free cups of milk tea, which is so delicious! I will come again."

I ordered snow crab legs as appetizer and mixed tofu soup for my entree.\nThe snow crab legs were crisp outside, tender inside, fresh and flavourful.  The tofu soup was rich, hearty and all the seafood was cooked perfectly.\nI liked that the entree comes with rice and so much banchan! It was very filling and I couldn\u2019t finish it all. I also enjoyed the authentic flavors of the food.\nTo top it all off, the restaurant is very thoughtfully designed, so you are immersed in an elegant dining experience."

Each dish came with a variety of side dishes, and the best part is they\u2019re refillable! The spicy octopus bibimbap wasn\u2019t as flavorful as I expected, and it didn\u2019t have that crispy rice at the bottom. The service was excellent, although the atmosphere was a bit noisy.

While the menu offers a variety of classic chaat and Indian dishes, the overall taste doesn\u2019t quite match the richness and authenticity I\u2019ve experienced at the Sunnyvale location. It\u2019s good for a casual meal, but not a standout.\n\nService: The service is alright, but it feels less polished compared to Sunnyvale. While the staff are generally helpful, the attentiveness and efficiency could be improved to create a more welcoming dining experience.\n\nAmbience: The ambience is simple and functional, but it doesn\u2019t have the same vibrant, inviting feel as the Sunnyvale location. It\u2019s a decent place to sit and enjoy a meal, but the atmosphere lacks the warmth and energy that makes the other location so enjoyable.\n\nOverall, Chaat Bhavan in Mountain View offers a reasonable option for Indian food, but it falls short when compared to the Sunnyvale branch. If you\u2019re nearby, it\u2019s worth a try, but I\u2019d recommend heading to Sunnyvale if you\u2019re looking for the best experience."

Upon arrival, the service was not what I\u2019d expect from a fine dining establishment. No one offered to take our coats, and I had to point out and ask multiple times before they understood it should be taken. The lack of attentiveness continued as we waited a long time for our order to be taken, which was frustrating.\n\nThat being said, the food was quite good, and I particularly enjoyed the smoked quail\u2014it was delicious. However, the overall atmosphere and service left much to be desired, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be returning in the future.

I usually don\u2019t like meat, but I like the grilled beef tongue here! Really juicy and fresh! We like the salad a lot and ordered twice a night! The fishes are good and fresh.\nJust be aware that there\u2019s an extra charge for bringing a cake here. But the fee is reasonable and they offer great service! Recommend for group meals!\nThe only shortcoming is - we don\u2019t like the Japanese table setting: it\u2019s not good for elder people since we can\u2019t stretch our legs like a normal seats. But it shouldn\u2019t be a problem for young people."

Loved it.\n\ud83e\udd57 Sakana Iroiro Salad \u2013 A nice Asian-fusion poke-style dish. The greens are especially flavorful, thanks to the creamy dressing.\n\ud83c\udf5a Buta Meshi \u2013 Rich and tasty overall, though nothing particularly special. I\u2019ve had Unagi before and found that more to my liking.\n\ud83c\udf63 Hamachi Carpaccio \u2013 It\u2019s definitely fresh and worth trying, though the flavor just didn\u2019t click with me. Others might enjoy it more.\n\ud83c\udf56 Gyutan Shioyaki \u2013 Very tough and hard to chew. Honestly not sure how people manage to eat it.\nI\u2019ve seen many recommendations to its pizza. Would probably try next time!"

The spicy kick from the jalape\u00f1os paired perfectly with the crispy, perfectly-breaded chicken. Everything about it was spot on. For $15, including a side, the sandwich was HUGE\u2014definitely too much for me to finish, which is saying a lot!\n\nI opted for coleslaw as my side, while my husband had the seasoned fries. Both were fantastic, though I was bummed they were out of mac and cheese. The fact that the restaurant is halal is a huge plus for me, and the staff was really friendly, making the experience even better.\n\nThis place is definitely one I\u2019ll recommend to others and would love to revisit! If you're in the area, don\u2019t miss it!"

The bun, veggies and cheese don't add much if you order the sandwich.\n\nLocation feels like it should just be a takeout spot, but I appreciate the seating."

The atmosphere was wonderful. We were seated comfortably, enjoying the ambiance next to the fireplace. The service and friendliness of the staff made me feel welcomed and special. The tasting menu was five stars. Each dish left my mouth more excited for the next. Elegant dining at its best. Thank you, Broma, for such a wonderful experience. I can't wait to come back."

As soon as we walked in, I felt like we had stepped into a real Japanese ramen house. The atmosphere was warm and cozy, with wooden decor, lanterns, and Japanese art that made it feel super authentic.\n\nFor our appetizer, we had the Takoyaki, which are octopus dumpling balls. They were crispy on the outside, soft and gooey on the inside, and topped with a delicious sauce and bonito flakes that danced from the heat, so cool to watch!\n\nFor the main dish, I ordered the Tonkotsu DX Ramen, and it was hands-down one of the best bowls of ramen I\u2019ve ever had! The broth was rich and creamy, full of deep flavors. The noodles were perfectly chewy, and all the toppings-chashu (braised pork), kakuni (slow-braised pork belly), bean sprouts, green onions, a soft-boiled egg, and dry seaweed made every bite incredible. I also got extra Kikurage mushrooms, which added a nice texture and earthy flavor.\n\nThe attention to detail in both the food and the decor really made the experience special. You can tell they put a lot of effort into making everything just right. I would definitely come back and recommend this place to anyone who loves real Japanese ramen!"

We ordered katsu curry, tan tan ramen, spicy tonkotsu ramen, veggi ramen and gyoza. I can say they highlight is tan tan ramen. The broth is very yummy. The tonkotsu broth is a bit on the light side. The noodle is cooked nicely. Gyoza is good and veggie soup is a bit back. The service is pretty good and the server is friendly.  I like the open kitchen concept. For me it is about 3.5 stars."

It\u2019s at the end of a small plaza a block north of ECR.  The parking lot was nearly full but turn over is fast.  There is some interior seating; a table and chair setup for about 14 people.  You order and pay at the counter from the menu board behind the counter.  I ordered the two piece dark meat, which came with a biscuit and fries.\n\nMy meal was brought to me shortly in a box with the biscuit in a bag.  The chicken had a crunchy breading and was very moist.  The fries were hot and crispy.  The biscuit was fall apart moist.  Every thing was tasty and a little salty.\n\nA very good neighborhood chicken place with reasonable prices.  I went here when they first opened for the catfish, which had a \u201cbottom of pond\u201d taste and I wouldn\u2019t recommend.  It\u2019s repeatable for the chicken."

It's in the Blossom Valley mall next to the Safeway so lot's of parking.  It was a little less than half full and I was seated promptly.  You order by scanning the QR code on the table and launching the URL which opens the menu tab in the browser.  I tapped the Pork Katsu with Curry Sauce and placed my order.\n\nThe interior is contemporary bench and table seating with wood furniture.  It was very clean with staff frequently cleaning the tables and floor.\n\nThe curry sauce in a gravy boat came first.  My food was brought to my table in a searing hot cast iron plate on a wood tray.  The dish consisted of rice topped with corn and green onions, the breaded pork katsu, raw red onion and raw mushrooms on the sides.  Make sure you stir the rice and vegetables immediately or the bottom of your rice will burn.  I then poured the curry over my rice.  The katsu breading was crispy but the cutlet was uneven in thickness so the thin part was dry and chewy but the thick part was tender and moist.  The curry had good flavor and is not spicy.\n\nI'll round up to 4 stars and forgive the uneven cutlet experience, I'd repeat."

My preferred beer was out of stock, so they comped me some hot sake for the trouble. Staff went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we asked for. At the time of visit, they were swamped with guests and had us seated in less than 15min. Every cut of meat I tried was tender and of quality taste. I had just about all the beef and pork cuts I can order. Stop by if you're ready to eat mountains of great tasting food."

The king oyster mushroom had a nice thick texture, which made it really good. The sauce bar was a little disappointing, with some sauces looking like they had been left out for too long, and it could use more variety. But overall, this is a solid place, and we will come back."

Solid food, large portions, cool interior and patio seating options.\n\nFood- 5 stars\nIt's a typical hotel restaurant which is slightly better than chain brunch spots. I very much enjoyed the free breakfast options here with their menu. Really can't go wrong with the standard options: eggs Benedict, omelettes, french toast, waffle. Tasted great and large portions\n\nService\nI would say they are slightly understaffed here as we did have to flag our waiter down towards the middle/end of our meal. Otherwise, the service was pretty solid\n\nBottom Line\nGood ambiance, good food and portions, and pretty good service. A good and reliable option if you're staying at the Hyatt Centric"

We had the fried shrimp basket with garlic fries and I believe one of the specials/combos with the house special sauce (mild). The house special sauce is just so delicious and especially paired with the lemons that they provide you. The seafood was fresh and seasoned beautifully. I loved the snap of the sausages. The fries and fried shrimp were seasoned well and were fried to crispy perfection. The cocktail sauce was perfect to counteract the oiliness of the fried food. I highly recommend the garlic fries as they are truly some of the best garlic fries I have ever had. Crispy, garlicky, buttery. They are divine. The service was impeccable and the food came out rather quickly. I highly recommend this place and I can't wait to come back!"

We ordered the friend oysters and soft-shell crabs.  Both fried dishes are very good.  Their french fries are better than sweet potato fries.\n\nGarlic noodles are just so-so, not much flavor and the noodles were overcooked.\n\nWhen it came to the seafood, we ordered the Signature Combo #2 with House Special sauce.  The sauce tastes good.  However the seafood wasn't cooked well.  Shrimps are not fresh and get mushy once shells were peeled.  The crab was overcooked.  Clams were the only items that were good.  It's very disappointing with the shrimps and crab."

Just follow the instructions on the kiosk.\n\nWe ordered three dish but forgot to order some white rice. So when I try to make my second order just for rice, the lady just said she would give me two orders for free! What a nice surprise and service!\n\nAll three dishes are on the salty side of my liking, I will ask for less salt when I order the next time!"

The results are satisfying and the added order of bulgogi is also great other than the price that is a bit high for the amount served. Overall, the service is great and the ambience is also nice and quiet. However, the price may be a turn-off for those who are price conscious."

We had specifically requested fajita veggies instead of meat, yet there were barely any vegetables inside\u2014mostly just lettuce on the side. The lack of well-seasoned veggies made it underwhelming.\n\nChips & Salsa: The complimentary chips and salsa were a nice touch. The chips were crisp, not too oily, and had just the right amount of salt\u2014better than what many other places serve.\n\nAmbience: A decent setup with a comfortable dining space, nothing particularly special but good for a casual meal.\n\nService: The service was good, with staff being attentive and friendly throughout the visit.\n\nOverall, the experience didn\u2019t quite live up to the positive reviews, mainly due to the lackluster vegetarian taco."

For the first time, my daughter ordered Mexican pizza. Not sure, if she\u2019ll ever order again. And to my surprise they had chicken wings on the menu. It\u2019s a Mexican restaurant. My son ended up getting chicken wings but it had no Mexican flavors. My husband ordered pork fajitas however he found it dry.\n\nCustomer service was great. Yesterday was National Margarita Day. We did celebrate by ordering house Margarita\u2019s which delicious. Totally recommending the margarita. And try the guacamole dip. You will love the crunchy chips.\n\nOverall, awesome experience."

Super cozy interior with a cute water buffalo plushie at the counter. Will be going back!!"

It\u2019s crispy on the top and moist and soft on the bottom. The tofu was delicious. Service was attentive. The waitress asked if we\u2019d like refills on the banchan, before we had a chance to ask for refills. Overall, we had a wonderful experience at Hansang Tofu and we will definitely return again."

However, we had to ask each time for the refills. They don't take initiative to keep it going. There are other places that don't offer a lot of service either but are efficient with replacing the banchan, which is more reminiscent of the places in Korea. They took forever in getting us the check too.\n\nAs for the other dishes, we felt the portion for the tofu soup was a bit small. The seafood pancake was crispy but didn't have much flavor or ingredients."

We also had the beef rendang,  penang lamb, and the curry laksa. They waiter who was very friendly and good. The main dished seem tamed it down a bit, wish we would have asked for it to be spicier. Very tasty though.\n\nOverall, a great experience and highly recommend."

No complaint about the service - the staff helping us at the counter was very friendly and helpful. I ordered soy garlic bone-in chicken which had a very good flavor and I like its crispiness and chicken was moist as well. The fries were perfect with super nice crunch. Pretty good first time impression. I'll definitely go back for this and try new flavors."

The food is good but not that impressive. Some of the dishes are a bit too sweet for me.\nThe service is really efficient. And the portion size is big. For 2 people, 4 dishes are definitely enough.\n\nOverall it is worth a visit."

They also have a restroom, which is handy.\n\nThe menu offers great options, including low-sugar and low-calorie desserts and drinks, making it perfect for anyone with dietary preferences. I personally loved their taro drink and black sesame pudding and the taro ube sago I tried at another location was equally fantastic.\n\nTheir refreshing drinks are a perfect pick-me-up, and the plaza itself is great, with lots of restaurants, shops, a grocery store, and even a Goodwill nearby\u2014perfect if you want to drop off donations before treating yourself to something sweet. Highly recommend this place for a mood-lifting treat!"

Because every restaurant and every chef have his own style but in this one particularly the food was in the dry side and that it\u2019s was makes the difference.\nThey have a very extensive menu with so many Dishes that you can\u2019t find in other Chinese restaurant.\nPortion are very generous (to share) and price are reasonable.\nWe ordered: potstickers (pork) they are big and 6 in the portion, chicken mu shu very generous  for an appetizer ( you need to ask for extra sauce) ,beef chow main a lot of noodles almost no veggies and small portion of beef and honey-walnut prawns good but almost no sauce. We appreciate very much the mango pudding that was on the house, I think was the manager arrived to ours table with the dessert and was an unexpected surprise, very nice touch. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.\nThe service was very good and attentive just a bite difficult to understand for the accent and mask.\nThe ambience looks elegant in comparison to others Chinese restaurants but using inexpensive decors , lighting, table cloth ( I think are disposable) , chairs are confortable also it\u2019s a big restaurant they have a lot of seating.\nIf you like to give a change remember, most of the dish\u2019s are for share unless you have a big appetite or like to take home the leftover."

Lauren was very kind, great smile and outstanding customer service. The food choices that she recommended definitely shows she knows her stuff. The food came to the table hot and delicious, my drink was extremely tasty. The atmosphere is still very family oriented which I love. It\u2019s over 5 years since I dine at a Macaroni Grill, only because it\u2019s the place that my sister, nephew and I would eat together. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to eat here after she passed from cancer. Today I couldn\u2019t resist and I wrote this review tears came rolling down my face. Thank you Lauren and Macaroni Grill for the amazing customer service & great memories.\n\nMy only concern would be that  I wasn\u2019t offer the soup or salad that should have come with the entr\u00e9e."

For lunch, I decided to try their Japanese-style chicken wings and mixed tempura. The mixed tempura was absolutely delicious, with a perfect light and crispy texture, but I was a bit disappointed with the chicken wings as they didn't quite meet my expectations.\n\nInterestingly, my friends ordered different dishes, and we had a great time sharing and tasting each other's meals. Our opinions about the food varied - some loved their choices, while others felt they were just okay. Overall, in my opinion, I would give the restaurant a 4 out of 5, primarily because of the delightful mixed tempura that left a lasting impression on my taste buds."

I\u2019m uploading both the photo from their website and what I actually received \u2014 I\u2019ll let the pictures speak for themselves. I don\u2019t expect the food to look exactly like the pictures in the menu but I\u2019m pretty sure I got less than 1/4 of the portion they advertised. The food tasted good, but I only got three super thin slices of chicken in my plate, looked nothing like what was shown online. I had ordered two plates, and while the second plate had four slices instead of three, it was still disappointing."

We spent around $45, which included 1 pound of food (priced at $15 per pound) and two drinks. I loved being able to customize everything and pick all the ingredients I wanted\u2014it made the experience even better.\n\nI asked the staff about the spice levels, and they warned me that the extra spicy was really intense. As a Korean, I opted for the regular spicy this time, and honestly, it wasn\u2019t very spicy at all\u2014probably mild by Korean standards. Next time, I\u2019m definitely trying the extra spicy!\n\nThe ingredients were super fresh, and there was plenty of parking, which was really convenient. The place seems pretty popular. We didn\u2019t have to wait, but I can see there being a line during busy lunch hours.\n\nAlso, there\u2019s a fantastic boba spot nearby! Grabbing a drink there after your meal is the perfect finishing touch. I\u2019ll absolutely be going back\u2014it was just that good!"

I actually prefer this tomato broth over the tomato broth in one of the other malatang places nearby. I also think their signature broth is quite delicious. Good selection of noodles, meats, and toppings. I really enjoyed dining here and despite the hectic dinner rush, the staff was pretty organized. I will come back again and recommend this place!"

I love how most items from the menu are displayed to see how they look like though they won't exactly replicate them being served to us, which is why I decided to take pictures of them.\n\nThe food is good though, but some food needs to be a bit warmed up like the pancit. Some tastes alright but they don't really stand out. Most of them taste like home since I grew up in a Filipino household. The portions of the entrees are appropriate for hosting a party. Desserts are amazing though!\n\nI recommend going to this restaurant for friends and family if you're willing to try Filipino food in the Bay Area."

They additionally have all you can eat chips with a salsa bar.\n\nThe Quesabirria tacos were cheesy and crisp and the au jus was not too salty, but added great flavor to the crispy tacos! The meat was tender and flavorful. The Birria tacos come with meat, cheese, onions, and cilantro.\n\nI added onions, cilantro, and salsa to the rice, and ate the chips with the beans and the rice.\n\nThe various salsas are tasty and not too spicy.\n\nAll in all a good experience, I will definitely be coming back to try some of their other menu items."

Rotating servers bring different items. Kachori wasn\u2019t fried properly. Gatta sabji was more like gatta kadi. There was also a plain kadi. Jalebi was cold.

I think their congee is better than most Chinese places I have been to because it came out burning hot which I like.  The place was busy so we were placed on waiting list for about 20 minutes.  You scan the QR code on your table to place your order.  I have 3 stars for the atmosphere because the place is small and not a fancy place.  You would come here for Southern Chinese food and not the ambience.  Price is reasonable."

        "comment": "It was Valentine's, I wanted to take my wife to a nice French restaurant but one of the reservation failed through, luckily I remembered this place that I took my girlfriend (my wife) 22 years ago. We both remembered this place, we didn't know it's still there after all these years since we never came back after we got married and moved.\nThe Google booking system is amazing, we got our confirmation right away. My wife was happy to come back to our first date years ago.\nThe restaurant is small, plenty of parking spaces, we came early because we went straight after work, we found the parking right away.\nThis is called French VN fusion restaurant, it's kinda like our favorite Le Colonial in SF but closed after 26 years in business.\nWe've been in Paris and tried quite a few restaurant there, we like escargots, steaks and ducks, but we still think the fusion restaurants taste as good or better.\nThe service here is so attentive, pleasant and happy, we liked it right away after all these years. The decor is quite nice IMHO, quite simple and not very pretentious.\nSo, French restaurant the escargots are a must, this place doesn't use the whole snails instead using the out-of-shell meats, with a little bread in a cup, kinda different. The important thing is the tastes, the meat is quite soft and flavorful, we both liked them very much. The bread dipped in the sauce is quite tasty.\nEverywhere we went, we love crispy calamari, and this place is excellent, the calamari is crispy but the meat is tender, the sauce are just plain tartar and cocktail sauce, they should make their own special sauce for this then it would be better. We finished these in a heartbeat.\nThe salad is included which is nice. The dressing is just right, I think it has a touch of fish sauce in it, very nice.\nThe main course, the #15 and #16 that we can hear people are ordering. we order both because we forgot what we ordered 22 years ago LOL. Actually both sauces are almost tasted the same, but my wife thought her pepper corn sauce tasted better than my Mushroom sauce. My wife likes the hot crunchy bread and butter instead of my red rice. They're both excellent eating with our sauces.\nThe steak is tender and does have texture, it's the sauce that counts.\nThe prices here are quite reasonable. We will come back here again to try different dishes when we're craving for another romantic outing event. It's not just the restaurant, it's how we love each other. When we're in love, everything is romantic and taste great LOL."

Food was just OK, I had the grilled pork chop vermicelli bowl, my cohort had a grilled pork chop with egg and rice. They were both OK, nothing special. The original owners had special menu items especially the beef onion rolls, not on the new menu."

I also got the hot and sour soup + egg roll + fried rice add-on, and the fried chicken wings. The green beans were very well prepared and tasted okay, but they just weren't what I had in mind. I'm gonna go back and get them without the breading next time. They were VERY plentiful, though. The egg roll was much better than your typical one. The soup tasted like most other hot and sour soups, so it also wasn't my favorite. I'll try the won ton next time. The fried rice was much better than average. Finally, the chicken wings were some of the best I have had in a long time. Perfectly cooked, tasty, crunchy. I'd go there just for those any day. Finally, the venue was clean and the gentleman at the counter was very nice. I will be back."

The owner did not say hello to me but said hello to the regulars/ other customers. I thought that was a bit odd but I was on my phone texting so maybe that was the reason.

Lots of locals like it.\n\nThe dancing dragon, caterpillar, and dinosaur rolls we ordered are on the sweet side. Maybe it's the sauce.\n\nThe sushi tasted fine. The high volume of customers ensures their fish is sold consistently.\n\nThe dining room  is medium-sized and might fill up quickly. Prepare to wait during busy periods.\n\nService is friendly and efficient, and parking should be fairly easy.\nI\nClientele is diverse, meaning a mix of old and young.

I see that the food looks good based on what I saw on the menu and so, I decided to try here.\n\nI wanted to get the Grandma Braised Chicken Rice since it\u2019s much affordable costing only around $11. It\u2019s a lot of ground meat and hearty ingredients filled in a bowl. It\u2019s a very small place, which isn\u2019t really good to dine-in in my opinion.\n\nI was quite shocked with how quick the service is. I was expecting it to be a little longer though since prepping a meal like this seems to take long."

The dumplings and wraps were both excellent. The noodles were tasty and chewy. We didn\u2019t care much for the pork belly, so we\u2019ll try something else next time."

The vegetables were fresh, not overcooked, retaining their texture and flavor. The peanut sauce was rich, not too thick, allowing the freshness of the ingredients to shine.\n\nWe started with lumpiang Shanghai, perfectly crisp and filled with savory meat. The Crispy Pata followed, living up to its name with a crispy exterior and juicy interior.\n\nThe Sisig, served sizzling, added an extra layer of excitement. Its balance of textures and flavors was spot on, with just the right amount of zing.\n\nThe family atmosphere combined with attentive service made our visit truly special. Miles Bistro is highly recommended for anyone seeking authentic Filipino cuisine."

The dinuguan was served on a sizzling hot pan and reminded me of what the dish would be like if it was dinguan sisig (style). As it turns out this is the best way to eat dinuguan. The blood is not too soupy and the consistency is great, and the flavors just pop with the added heat and subtle peppers.\n\nThe arroz caldo was not the highlight of the meal but still very good. I'm not sure if adding fried chicken inside the soup adds much to the dish (I would have preferred it to the side). On a cold day, it was warm, comforting, and not too salty.\n\nService was perfect. Got two takehome boxes and the food microwaved well. Ang sarap!\n\nNice comfortable indoor vibes. Will return with my sister soon."

One time they only had cheese slice and added pepperoni since that's what we wanted.\nSlices can be expensive, two slices and two pops costs $18. I finally grew a brain and got a large half cheese half pepperoni which has 8 large slices for $33, so l recommend doing that. One thing that also made me want to order a full pizza is that the slices aren't evenly cut. One time I got a slice and it was huge another time I got a slice and it was smaller than the first one. Ordering a whole pizza is the way to go!\nIt's a no frills kinda place, seating on the inside, parm & red pepper shakers for you to bring back to your table.\nSome TVs and a Statue of Liberty to remind you of NY hehe.\nOverall, I love love love this place!!! I love how thin the crust is, it makes it so easy to eat, I ate up my portion of the cheese half no issue. Just writing this review is making me crave it so bad. Highly recommend this for NY thin pizza! Not doughy and you won't be weighed down after eating it!"

Love the Vada - crispy on the outside, flavourful and light on the inside.\n\nThe sambar has had a lot of variations in taste each time. It tastes great but some days the salt and spice levels are higher.\n\nThe curd rice was however disappointing with no flavor (barely any curry leaves or white urad dal), extra extra salt and served with an even saltier pickle. The rice was clumped and there were large chunks of plain rice.\n\nOverall great place and love the options of some ready to go curries, idly and dosa batter which have also been great so far."

A few tables are available if you want to swallow that goodness and can\u2019t wait to get home.\n\nTaste is as trusty and consistent as ever. The Tatte idli is awesome and fluffy. The dosas crispy and the curries bring back the flavors of madras to your mouth and memories to your mind.\n\nStaff is prom and proper and courteous without being performative."

I expected it all to be cooked together like when I go to a Thai restaurant. Easily this is the most expensive dog food I have given my dog in a while first and last visit. Ironically enough it is a popular location so I must assume that their soups are what are good cause it feels like a sub par and over priced Panda Express. Unfortunate that my first experience was so bad I can\u2019t give them a second chance."

I ordered a couple of sandwiches, and they were stale\u2014completely disappointing. This is not just about poor quality; it\u2019s a serious risk to customers\u2019 health. Proper food safety measures need to be ensured to prevent such issues.\n\nLove the veggie bagel, egg salad sandwich and Eggs Benedict. The veggie sandwich and egg plant with goat cheese are also good."

I ordered a large sugar cane juice, and when it was brought to me, the cup was only about three-quarters full. I asked the waiter why it wasn\u2019t filled to the top, especially since I paid for a large. She told me that to get a full cup, I\u2019d need to pay an extra dollar.\n\nI then asked, isn\u2019t the point of a larger drink to have a full cup? Her response was that I had asked for no ice, so that\u2019s why the cup was not filled. I didn\u2019t want to argue further, but I left feeling frustrated. Honestly, I didn\u2019t want to risk anything happening to my food if I pushed the issue. It\u2019s a shame because I really do like the place, but this left a bad taste in my mouth."

Every dish we ordered was expertly prepared and beautifully presented, with flavors and aromas that were simply irresistible. It felt like a delicious indulgence! In fact, it was the first time we didn\u2019t even ask for boxes for our leftovers because we enjoyed everything so much. While the portions seemed small at first, they turned out to be perfect for sharing with family and friends.

Cooked just right !!  It was definitely more than 1 person can eat, but great size.\n\nThey had a special Ravioli with Salmon, it was awesome.  The ravioli itself was fresh and the salmon was flavorful.\n\nI also tried the tartufo desert - first of all the presentation was amazing and the taste was out of this world.  It was great to pair this with a cafe latte \u2026.\n\nThe staff was friendly and very knowledgeable- I will be back !!"

The food was fantastic, our server was good until he was pulled away for a large party near the end of our meal. The wine choices were good and the desserts were special.\nThe music selection was a bit loud. It was pop music which made it hard to hear and didn't give the right atmosphere in my opinion."

My friend had the lasagna. Food is consistently good at this restaurant.\n___________________________________________________\nCame to this restaurant at downtown Campbell on a Friday night prior to 8:30pm. The restaurant has a nice modern setting. Ordered the flaky pastry appetizer which has shredded vegetables between it, sitting on a cream sauce. I had the pappardelle pasta with lobster and my friend had the penne pasta with sausage. The food servings at this restaurant is generous compared to most Italian restaurants. I really like that my pasta was served fresh from the kitchen, pipping hot. There was also a generous amount of lobster that I was able to get a bite of lobster with every bite of the pappardelle. It was a huge serving but I finished every bit of it cos\u2019 it was that delicious. For dessert, I ordered the tartufo in dark chocolate. It tasted like regular dark chocolate gelato to me, but my friend claimed that it was very rich and creamy. Overall, it is a very tasty meal on the pricier side, although I think the taste and quality of the fresh ingredients justify the price. Definitely recommend this restaurant if you want good and high quality italian food."

The same with the meat on them a bit cold. The lemon orzo wasn\u2019t my cup of tea either.\n\nThe cheesesteak gyro was good and I was surprised that the salad did not have any leaves in it FYI was tasty. Mostly onion, pepper and tomato.

The Chicken Enchiladas were way better, the chips were better, and the red salsa wasn't so watered down as if they just added water to make it so thin!! $5.19 for chips and salsa? Should have skipped it! Never again!!\n\nAnd oh, forgot to mention the soda fountain didn't work for any drinks! It just put out syrup and no soda for all drinks except water!!"

They have a very creative bar with some fun concoctions and the manager Kendrick was helpful in chosing.  The staff was attentive and interior decor was cool.  What blew us away were the taco plates! We ordered the Birria and Chicken Tinga  and both were fantastic.  We will definitely return to try other things."

The outside patio has heaters and you can enjoy the downtown feels.\nService was great! Our waitress was efficient and kind. The manager (assuming here) never stopped moving the whole evening. He was here and there and everywhere. Always making sure that everyone had what they needed, whether it was the staff or the patrons.\nI felt like the cocktails we got were just so-so; a little bland, but pretty. The al pastor street tacos were better once adding the lime included. The crispy fish tacos needed the lime also, in my opinion.\nEven though I'm only giving it a 3-star review, I think it has potential. It wasn't a bad experience at all. Perhaps if we would have sat outside and had different dishes it could have been a 4."

Everything went well from the service, ordering process, the ambience to the freshness of the food and fantastic drink and dessert!\n\nThis Pacific Catch location is conveniently located in the Pruneyard, next to Marshall and Trader Joe\u2019s side of the plaza. Parking was reasonably available.\n\nWe went there on a Monday night at 7pm and the place was pleasantly not crowded at all. We loved that we were greeted warmly and then seated promptly at one of the most beautiful places in the restaurant - in the heated patio and next to the cool blue-light \u201cfireplace\u201d. But honestly everywhere in this restaurant is pretty! I love the vaulted ceiling with statement rattan lights hanging off it.\n\nOur server Zach was attentive yet gave us some space and time. He also gave us some suggestions on which drinks to order, which we appreciated. We opted for the Trio Sampler, which had original ahi tuna poke, Serrano ahi poke and Baja shrimp poke, and the West Coast style salmon.\n\nWe dived into our food as soon as they came out. The dishes were aesthetically presented. All the ingredients tasted so fresh and healthy. We were surprised to find the brown quinoa rice (which came with the grilled salmon dish) were soft and flavorful. The salmon was delicious with the right amount of moisture and flavorings.\n\nThe Trio Sampler also held a candle to the grilled salmon dish. We couldn\u2019t decide which poke we loved the best as we finished them all LOL\n\nZach was smart to present the dessert menu to us in the middle of our meal so we knew to pace ourselves. After not much of the debate, my friend and I picked the Hula Brownie Sundae, which was another highlight of the night. The brownie was moist and had that night balance of bitterness of chocolate and sweetness from the cake. We loved how coconut shreds and macadamia nuts complemented each other nicely and made the entire dessert an epic.\n\nOverall, we were very satisfied with our meals and the experience. We\u2019ll definitely come back soon!"

Kayla G did a great job she was our main server but her team were super great as well!\n\nThe food matches the aesthetics! Not only is the inside so nice but the food is incredible! Very tasty and doesn\u2019t make you feel like that heavy full. Even the desert was great !\n\nThe ambiance is beautiful! Loved the dim lights (we went around 7pm), the interior design and decor was so pleasing to look at. Such a vibe !\n\nNow the music, that playlist was slappin! R&B vibes all night and it was loud enough where you can have a great time but still have a conversation.\n\nWe went on a Thursday night for my bff bday dinner, when we walked in they added a special touch to the table decor to acknowledge her bday! So thoughtful and very much appreciated.\n\nI brought my toddler (2 y/o) and had no problems! I will say maybe the weekend is not toddler friendly and a different vibe after 8pm since it closes late.\n\nClean and good smelling bathroom !\n\nThey have different options, high tables, regular tables, booths and lounge seating.\n\nAs you can see, this place was a hit !"

The server was friendly, though I think they were understaffed.\n\nThe bad: They weren't quick on getting food out, so it sat a bit and wasn't hot.  Examples being Tater Tot Fondue, where cheese had developed the skin and the tots were not hot. Also, the Fried Pickles were over fried, and then also not hot. So that sucked. It had a great sauce though.\n\nThe fine: The Chicken Sandwich and Club were both fine, they had decent flavor.\n\nI'd probably go back for a beer and a snack, but I wouldn't seek it out."

The service was good from the bartender, but that was all. Apparently, this establishment had been bought a couple of times by different entities.  The burbon blue cheese burger was sad, starting with the buns were just like flat bread with no fluff and tasteless, along with the plain flavor fries that were not even hot, just warm. Just go elsewhere like In N out for food and it'll also cost less. Trust me."

We walked into a large band playing traditional music.\nThe music was slightly too loud, but we were close to the band.... And trumpets are quite loud. Overall, the music was enjoyable.\nI had the steak fajitas and they were delicious.  They were hot, and fresh and plenty of it.\nThe service was good, but not spectacular as they were busy, but everyone was trying their hardest.\nI was never served my second Coke, but was charged for it.  I had to ask for it to be removed from the bill.\nBecause of the service this would normally been only a 4-star review but a manager (?) stopped by our table and replaced our nasty diet cola in a can with a bottle of Coke made with real sugar.  They do not serve fountain drinks so and that was kind of weird.\nOverall we enjoyed our vusit and will visit here again."

What really stood out, though, was the inclusion of mocktails on the menu\u2014a refreshing option that\u2019s often hard to find elsewhere. Overall, it was a pleasant dining experience."

Would definitely recommend a stop in here especially for a cozy drink.\nThey have a pretty good happy hour for drinks.\nI was not otherwise impressed with the food, which was presented well, however the flatbread was salty and other items not memorable (had the warm nuts, deviled eggs and hummus).\nI think the highlights were the attentive staff and the alcoholic drinks. I would stop by again for sure!"

I would have to recommend the American Smoke if you're a fan of whiskey sours. The crudos were both amazing but I think the hamachi fish was better while the salmon's miso sauce was better. The ricotta gnocchi were unlike any gnocchi I've had before and were absolutely amazing. The scallops and brown butter hummus was perfectly executed and delicious. The braised short rib was so filling it was a perfect finale to the meal. But of course we had room for the cheesecake which again was just divine. All in all an amazing experience made even better by the fact that Chef Tucker takes some time to walk around the dining room and talk to the guests. Cannot say enough good things about the restaurant."

From start to finish, every detail was thoughtful and elevated \u2014 it\u2019s so exciting to have a creative and refined spot like this added to the South Bay dining scene.\n\nWe started with the sunchoke appetizer, which was absolutely delicious and beautifully plated. The flavors were rich and layered, and the presentation was stunning. We also had the hamachi crudo appetizer, which had the perfect balance of chili oil heat and coconut essence \u2014 such a creative combination that really worked. Each plate is designed to be shared and experienced, which made the meal feel interactive and fun. The variety on the menu is impressive \u2014 there\u2019s truly something for everyone.\n\nA major highlight were the short ribs\u2014 melt-in-your-mouth tender and packed with flavor \u2014 and the Dubai cheesecake was the perfect way to end the meal. It was light, creamy, and had such a unique flavor profile. I also had a beautifully crafted mocktail (I wish I could remember the name!), but it was so well-balanced and refreshing.\n\nThe vibrancy of each plate was remarkable \u2014 edible flowers and bright, fresh ingredients made every dish feel like a work of art. The atmosphere is modern and lively, making it a perfect spot for a date night or a night out with friends.\n\nTo top it all off, Chef Tucker herself stopped by our table to say hello. She was so warm and down-to-earth \u2014 it\u2019s clear that her passion and creativity are reflected in every dish.\n\nWe\u2019re already looking forward to coming back once brunch starts in a few weeks \u2014 if dinner is any indication, brunch is going to be incredible! Lira is such a gem, and I can\u2019t wait to explore more of the menu soon."

I like that there is even an option for zero percent sugar for the tea which is not available in many boba tea shops. Next, the selection of cuisines available for ordering is also a pleasant surprise when even dim sum cuisine from Koi Palace is shown as an option. Also, the Big Vons pizza is very yummy but it is a bit oily for me. Finally, I like their big display on the Wall which shows the progress of each order from the customer. A very nice place to warrant a second or third visit.\n\nNote: Add some photos after my second visit today."

The food is consistently delicious, the service is friendly and fast, and the portions are very generous for a very reasonable price.\n\nI\u2019ve tried several dishes, and each one has impressed me. I\u2019ve had their carne asada tacos, philly cheese chicken, patty melt, smashed burger, nachos, clubhouse, prawn cocktail and chicken tortellini soup.\n\nTheir desserts are truly next level! The pistachio cake is so light and flavorful, the chocolate temptation cake is so rich, but the real showstopper is their cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. It\u2019s served inside a fresh pineapple. The top is the classic cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and the bottom has a layer of caramelized pineapple. It\u2019s absolutely amazing!\nI highly recommend this place."

The food was well portioned, well priced, and one of the most delicious meals I\u2019ve had. The chef and owner is friendly and welcoming to our party of 6. She accommodated us very well and I would definitely return for meals and takeout."

The service was friendly, though a bit slow during peak hours. As for the food, some dishes were flavorful\u2014especially the tacos\u2014but others felt a bit underwhelming for the price. Drinks were solid, especially the margaritas. Overall, not a bad place, but there's definitely potential for a more consistent experience. Lastly we ordered spicy pineapple cocktail which was great\nFish Taco was nice and delicious chicken tacos were ok in taste , it can be better .."

While the ambiance was phenomenal as they had plenty of outdoor and indoor seating as well as a bar, the food was unfortunately extremely mediocre.\n\nI got the Quesabirria tacos and the food came out in a reasonable time. The tacos themselves were extremely wet already with some grease and they were just soggy and had no crunch to them making it some kind of tortilla soup which I didn\u2019t enjoy. While the meat(beef) was tender, it had little to no actual flavor. The consome which is what is supposed to be the highlight of Quesabirria tacos was unfortunately underwhelming as it too had no flavor. The chips and salsa for me were really good though, as the salsa and chips tasted fresh. The tomatillo salsa was my favorite.\n\nEl guapo\u2019s was extremely cheap for a nice restaurant in downtown as my dish which was sufficient for my whole dinner was only about $11 with tax which was great! Overall, while I would not come back to el guapo\u2019s again due to their mediocre food I would recommend this joint to others because of its affordability and prime location!"

The ramen broth is quite flavorful with a good amount of spice, and the food tastes fresh. One of my favorites.  Limited parking is the only issue with the location, I would recommend skipping the lot entirely and finding somewhere else to park."

When going with groups, I love to order the antipasto, caprese, garlic bread with the mozzarella, and a salad to start. Then a pasta and pizza or two depending on the group size. You can't go wrong with a classic Margherita, but I also recommend both the Quattro Stagioni and Formaggio, as well as the Prosuitto Arugula. When it comes to dessert, I've had them all and you can't go wrong. They all hit the spot in their own way. And if you have a guest little or otherwise, they can do a simple butter pasta as well."

It was a Sunday night, and the restaurant was nearly empty\u2014no wait for a table, which was nice.\n\nWe started with sweet potato fries, which came out quickly. Then we ordered three rolls of vegan sushi and some baos. As vegetarians, we appreciated that they had decent plant-based options with tofu. But despite the restaurant not being busy, the service was really slow. The baos took forever to arrive, and even the sushi took longer than expected. We had our 8-year-old kids with us, and they were getting restless waiting for food.\n\nSince the portions weren\u2019t very filling, we ordered sizzling vegetables with tofu, and\u2014surprise\u2014it also took ages to come out. While the food itself was great, the wait times were frustrating.\n\nTo top it off, they automatically added a 20% gratuity for our party of six (four adults, two kids). The prices were already insanely high\u2014both appetizers and entrees felt way overpriced. We ended up with a $200 bill, which just didn\u2019t feel justified given the service.\n\nTheir sushi is good, no doubt, but they really need to step up their service if they\u2019re going to charge those prices and demand a 20% tip. Not sure I\u2019d go back with this kind of experience."

I always make room for the desserts also, as they are phenomenal.\nOne side note is that there is always a line on the weekends and there is a longer wait for serve times when they are busy."

The aromas you smell before getting to the door are fantastic. As you dine in the Chefs cooking at your table make it a entertaining and fun experience. The Food is just as great as the smell. I highly recommend The Chicken, Steak, or Lobster, paired with some shrimp, fried rice and vegetables.\n\nNext time I go ill be sure to get a picture of my plate before its all gone.."

You order at the register & they bring you the food. We got 2 gyro wraps, each wrap costs about 13$, an order of fries to share, loukoumades, and a piece of baklava. All in all is was about 43$\nThe gyro wraps were a hefty size and loaded with meat and other ingredients. I would definitely get it again. Gyro was perfectly thinly sliced and the tzatziki was incredible!\nThe fries were eh, straight from the freezer fries and we all know fresh cut is the best. I would still get them again tho lol\nLoukoumades (like little greek donuts if you don't know) were so incredible! I feel like it's a rare find so when I saw them on the menu, I knew I had to get and they were delish, crunchy on the outside and chewy in the middle!\nBaklava was incredible too.\nWe went on a Friday night and it was chilly, but they have outdoor seating with fire heaters going which I appreciated. If it was a bit warmer, I would've sat outside!\nSeating on the inside is standard. All in all, this will be a repeat meal for me!"

Use real feta, not this stuff. Make the cheese more prominent. This picture on the cheese front is well, pathetic. I paid almost $3 extra for this over the regular fries. Is this $3 worth of feta??? No. Is it even real feta??? Skeptical. Possible, but who shreds feta (my advice\u2014use a \u201ccrumbled\u201d type of feta).

When the meal arrived, I was amazed by the 3 large portions of chicken parmesean. I then realized the meal is meant to be shared as it is served with platter utensils to serve others.\nThe chicken tasted pretty good, but I tasted nothing in the marinara that was special or even tasty.\nThe service was absolutely nothing to praise.  We were not offered any bread until it was requested. Our waitress walked past our table 4X before I flagged down a waiter that had passed my table twice for a drink refill.\nThe building and decor are dated and well worn.  The bathroom was also well worn but was clean.  The cushions in our booth seating literally had springs pushing up and should have been replaced years ago.  The poop stains on the toilet seat were gross.\n\nI could see coming here if I had to feed the visiting grandkids or the like as the portion sizes make this place very economical when feeding (paying for) a group.\nOverall, I did not come with a group as it was just the two of us on a date. Since we eat out often, this place was a dud.\nWe did not visit here to forfeit flavor for portion size.  The mediocre (flat) flavor, combined with poor service and a very run-down facility, make this a disappointing visit.\nAnd what's with the head on the lazy-susan with the bust of a Pope?"

The best I can say is that it's filling for those who eat the food.\n\nFor a party of 12, we had a huge pile of spaghetti which was topped with an insufficient amount of cheap grocery store sauce. The lasagna was dry. How does that happen? The Chicken Parm was decent, even though the chicken was dry and under seasoned. Oh, and it was no surprise to see \"Kraft\" parmesan cheese in a shaker on the table. The food may be a feast for the eyes, but not for the palate."

The  Taco salad was ok but would have been better with beans in it. For almost 16 bucks,\nit should have had beans in it! Chile Verde for almost $19 was overpriced and the meat did not taste good at all. It was big chucks of meat that tasted \"gamey\". Got a different plate of what should have been a chicken enchilada but it tasted more like chicken and mole. All together the 3 of us felt it was a little overpriced for $60+ dollars and no refund for the bad chile verde. Got a lesser priced plate in return.\nThe refried beans were yum. The rice on our plates was mushy and overcooked. We did not eat too much of it.  This restaurant was rated like a 4+ star on yelp and google... it was our first time and we didn't feel that rating ...wanted to give only 2 stars for the food (sadly the pictures look better than the food actually was)...but like I said, the cashier man and the young lady at the bar gave nice service to us."

        "comment": "UPDATED REVIEW 2024/09\nthey moved to a new location where is right next to Grocery Outlet, just a few steps away from the original place. There\u2019s a 20% discount for dining in to the end of September, kind of celebration of the opening. Unfortunately I have to downgrade on this second visit (though it\u2019s my first time at the new location) because the food quality is just average. I had beef stew with rice today thanks to the accommodating staff who let me swap the egg noodles for rice. The soup tastes a bit too sweet, with nothing much else going on. You can't really taste the freshness of the ingredients. The beef is cut way too square, like it came straight from a factory. The pork has that gamey flavor and wasn\u2019t properly sliced before serving on the plate. The rice isn't wet or sticky and tastes great, but some were clumped together, which is a bit disappointing.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW\nThe restaurant has excellent natural light, and the vintage booth seating by the wall is very cozy and welcoming. We enjoy eating BBQ pork slices and BBQ chicken rice plates there. Delicious food, super comforting with everything in a decent portion size. Solid for the price. Service is speedy. We\u2019ll certainly have to come back when we\u2019re in the area again."

The cod was perfectly seasoned with a melt-in-your-mouth tenderness unlike any cooked fish I\u2019ve ever had before. The prawns were incredibly succulent with an aromatic curry flavor. Overall, the food was excellent!\n\nThe only miss for me was the oysters \u2014 they had a noticeably fishy aftertaste and didn\u2019t seem particularly fresh. I also wasn\u2019t a fan of the sweet prickly pear sauce they were served with. However, all the other dishes were so delicious that it\u2019s still 5 stars from me."

Each dish showcases the vision with which One Fish's menu has been crafted, with creative combinations and inspired pairings for both food and drink. I would highly recommend the 5 course family style meal, it takes you through a great variety of foods that are all delicious. There are dishes that will surprise you, awe you, and give you a sense of fun, all the while being extremely tasty of course.\n\nThe hospitality is also top tier, it's clear that the staff care about making sure you enjoy your time there. Each time I have been (which isn't nearly enough times since I found out about One Fish) I have always had a wonderful experience. Thanks very much to Josh and the rest of the One Fish crew for such a great time there every time!"

While the outside was crispy, inside it was still raw and pasty.\nThe rice was also undercooked and hard. It took them more than 20mins to get the food ready, which is fine if the food was worth the wait. It was just terrible, and we couldn\u2019t finish what we ordered. How does a Greek place not get their falafels right? The only thing decent was the chicken gyro. Not recommended"

The flavors were authentic, fresh, and just as fantastic as I remembered.\n\nThe staff were amazing, even better than ever. What made this visit even more special was that the owner himself prepared the meal.

This is a counter order, deliver to your table establishment which is great for groups, since you don't have to worry about split checks. The serving sizes are plentiful and there is a ton of variety. Their shakes are delicious, but you can also order a soda or something from the bar. There tons of side options, I love the Cajun fries! I'm determined to keep going back ordering something new off the menu every time. \ud83d\ude09\ud83e\udd23"

We tried the Steak Burger Bowl, which was a great (and healthier) option if you\u2019re watching your diet. We also had the Blue Cheese Burger, Jalape\u00f1o Cheddar, and Mushroom Swiss Burger, and every single one was fantastic. The flavors were spot on, the ingredients fresh, and the burgers cooked to perfection.\n\nTheir fries are fantastic too! We got both sweet potato fries and regular fries, and they were crispy and delicious. Plus, their prices are fair and not expensive, making this spot even better.\n\nIf you\u2019re craving a great burger and fries, this is the place to be! Highly recommend!"

Unfortunately (I know this'll sound weird) the fork's texture was very disagreeable and bugged me throughout the whole meal. If you're sensitive to different metals in cutlery, I'd keep this in mind!\n\nBesides that, the portion was huge, which was great! But I also would've appreciated a bit of more protein. Service was super nice too. Overall; decent place!"

My vegan Banh Mi sandwich had fresh ingredients and creative combinations that made me rethink what a sandwich can be. The sweet potato soup was smooth and velvety with a touch of savory depth. Every Thursday, kids eat free, making this not just a great place for a meal but a welcoming space for families. Plus, they throw in crayons and coloring pages to keep the little ones entertained. Friendly staff and generous portions - this is the kind of spot that keeps you coming back."

Anyways, you can see that there are plenty of decorations inside and it\u2019s mostly about sports. It also gives you a good vibe of living in the Philippines since the environment of that place tends to be like.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the food. I am quite impressed that they serve us food in more cultural plates with a leaf sticking at the top. The food is also delicious and authentic. Really great choice of seasonings especially on the garlic rice and pork sisig! No wonder this place is so popular especially on Yelp.\n\nIt\u2019s also great that they leave utensils out there unlike most restaurants where you have to ask them for extra. Honestly wish that they have more individual plates options in the menu, but that\u2019s fine. I came here for breakfast and popularity of it anyways!"

The burrito bowl had generous portions of chicken, rice, beans, and salsa, and the chicken fajita contained a lot of spicy chicken strips. The restaurant filled up quickly while we were there, and I could see why. By the end of our meal we knew that we would visit again."

A group of 6 was at our table and they started after us which gave us the kitchen without a rush.  Something to ask about, they looked crowded,  Overall, a very nice evening, but make sure you ask pricing on wine.    We picked a $10-12 bottle of wine we knew, and we\u2019re charged $75.00.   Our fault for not confirming the upcharge 100%\u2026 but that was a bit of a buzz kill after paying for the event $$$ and then the wine$$$$,  but still a nice evening"

We hoped for something amazing, but the food was just  good - simple and tasty. Sometimes that's enough, right?\nWe really liked the appetizer mix, especially the steamed meatloaf. The wonton soup was great too - fresh, warm, and full of dumplings. The banh mi sandwich was alright; the chicken was steamed, not grilled, so it was a bit soft, but still okay. What made our visit special was the service - everyone was super nice and quick. It was a good place to eat, with a friendly vibe."

If we were to order again, we would request extra crispy as the center was watery.\nWe got the chicken pesto, and it was average. Not a strong pesto flavor, but the portion is good size. I wouldn't order chicken again. It was small cubed pieces that seemed as if they might have been frozen at some point.\nThe garlic bread is probably their strongest contender. Soft and tasty.\nMy biggest problem and why I would only get takeout is they were cleaning the kitchen while we were eating and the cleaner was so strong, I had to get out asap. It was making me physically ill and on the edge of vomiting. :( Even if I didn't have sensitivity to odors, I don't think anyone likes to smell chemicals while they are eating. It doesn't allow you to taste the food at all.\nI guess the positive is that the place is probably clean, but I can't risk getting a migraine or getting ill from it.\nIt is very loud in the place even with only a few people and the kitchen staff going back and forth with a cart of dishes clanking as he goes over the carpet (3 times in the 40 minutes we were there) was less than pleasant.\nThe place is very old school and very 'rough around the edges'. You grab your own forks, plastic plates, and super thin napkins. It's a good place for families. I'm sure because of the portion sizes and prices, just know what you're getting into when going.\nThey seem very nice, so I'm torn with a not so great review, but I think honesty is the only way restaurants can know opinions and try to retain customers."

The restaurant exudes a lively and inviting ambiance, making it an ideal spot for both casual gatherings and special occasions.\n\nWe began our meal with the Guacamole, artfully presented in a traditional stone molcajete and accompanied by fresh salsa. The guacamole was rich and flavorful, perfectly complemented by the salsa\u2019s zest. The accompanying chips, though slightly firm, provided a satisfying crunch that paired well with the creamy dip.\n\nFor the main course, we opted for the Birria Tacos, featuring tender, slow-braised beef enveloped in warm tortillas. The depth of flavor in the birria was remarkable, and the dish was elevated by the addition of fresh cilantro and onions, graciously provided upon request by our attentive waitress.\n\nDesiring a take-home treat, I ordered the Birria Pizzadilla to go. This innovative fusion dish combines the savory essence of birria with the cheesy indulgence of a quesadilla, all packaged thoughtfully with extra condiments to enhance the experience at home.\n\nTo accompany our meal, I indulged in a vibrant blue cocktail, the LaToxica, which offered a delightful medley of fruity flavors and a refreshing finish. The drink menu at Tostadas is extensive, featuring a variety of creative cocktails that cater to diverse palates.\n\nOverall, Tostadas delivers a memorable dining experience with its dynamic atmosphere, courteous service, and delectable dishes. I eagerly anticipate my next visit to explore more of their enticing menu offerings."

        "comment": "When I rate a restaurant, there are three factors: quality of Salsa/ chips, the main plate, and the drink itself.\n\nDifferent categories within those three.\n\nIs the salsa unique? Are the chips fresh or too oily? Is the plate warm? The value of the plate vs volume?  Is the margarita well mixed? Is the margarita \"syrup\" or feels hand crafted? Size of drink vs alcohol content vs price.\n\nBonus pts for atmosphere cleanliness and the overall \"Vibe\"\n\nThe atmosphere here is beautiful but I tend to find that shows as an increases in price.\n\nThe salsa didn't have enough flavor or kick to it. The chips were too oily IMO.\n\nThe plate I ordered, I did not care for the style of sausage, but honestly was pretty tasty, could use a larger portion of has browns, which were cooked amazingly \ud83c\udf73\ud83d\udc4c\n\nThe mimosa came out a bit \"sad\" IMO. It wasn't full enough for $12. It only needed a few more ounces.\n\nOn the service level, the gentlemen was friendly, yet soon forgot about me once my plate was out. No one came by for 25 min and I was ready for the check. Still polite, I thanked them for their time.\n\nI do plan to return, as their happy hour of M-F 9@? To 12pm is intriguing.\n\nTime will tell."

This place is a local gem, family owned, all ingredients freshly prepared every day, most delicious and much healthier option compared to any other taco shops (I usually get sick after one meal at other taco shops).

I got four chicken strips, not chicken nuggets, chicken strips, and one very small packet of dipping sauce. They\u2019ve also changed the type of dipping sauce so it\u2019s much smaller and I\u2019m sure they get a better deal on it but they would only give one small packet for four chicken strips not sure I\u2019ll come back probably not\n\nSo they saved five cents on not giving me a second dipping sauce and it cost them future sales.  Makes zero sense.\n\nI added a photo so you can tell that I\u2019m not just a complainer. It\u2019s very small packet of sauce with four large chicken strips..it was over $9.00.  You would think you\u2019d be able to have two sauces"

The chicken is insanely good, the biscuits are moist and sweet, the fries are bomb. This is the most unlikely place to get dinner for the family, but I do it and everyone loves it. Service and atmosphere are what you would expect....it's a gas station."

They have an outdoor dining area, and I believe that they still have live music during weekend brunch and weekend evenings.\nI usually have Italian entr\u00e9es but this time for lunch we had the Bella burger which was really big and tasty with fries that were very good. I was really full after lunch. Also posted a few pics of more food that we've eaten.\nLatest update:\nSat at the bar yesterday, and Wendy and Ben, the bartenders were really nice and made really good drinks! Started with a Negroni and then some wine. To eat, we started with the crab cakes, then for entrees, Eggplant Parmesan and Linguine Bolognese. For dessert we shared the Pecan Turtle pie. Everything was delicious! With  dessert, also had an Expresso martini and Expresso."

The bread is homemade and also very good.\nMy wife tried the Halibut special and my son the fettuccine Bolognese.\nThe appetizer was excellent, the wine sauce was delicious. My pasta was OK, a little over done even for fresh pasta. The red sauce was good.\nThe Bolognese was also excellent and the pasta was better. The Halibut was yummy."

We were their first OpenTable reservation :) we showed up and did to a glitch they didn't have us on the books, but no worries at all.. they shifted some tables around and we were seated.\n\nThis was a prefix menu, which made ordering super easy.. and much to our surprise.. such an amazing choices of flavors and textures. We started with a duck appetizer salad, followed by cod (OMG sooooo good) topped with lamb. Honestly, it was all made to perfection.\n\nThere is a wine and beer menu available.. minimal choice. We were recommended pinot with dinner.. it was fine.. not amazing as the food.\n\nDessert was simple and delicious!! I could've had two \ud83d\ude01\n\nThe staff were attentive enough (i.e. not annoying) and very nice. Our water was consistently filled, utensils changed between meals, etc.\n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant is fine. Would be so much better with better, warmer lighting. Although the kitchen is semi open to the space, there wasn't too much noise nor smell to be distracting.\n\nOverall, gem of a find.. must try!! We'll be back for sure!!"

The clam chowder soup was delicious, but unfortunately, the rest of the dishes didn\u2019t live up to expectations. The beef portion was disappointing, as it was mostly fat and tendons with little actual meat, and the cut I received was already small to begin with. For dessert, I received a tiny slice, much smaller compared to what other customers were served."

The lighting and decor are sophisticated and warm. Service was exceptional.\n\nThe food is nothing short of extraordinary. Every course was a masterpiece - beautifully presented, bursting with flavor, and perfectly paired with wines recommended by the knowledgeable sommelier. The tasting menu was an absolute highlight, offering a delightful variety of innovative dishes that left us both amazed and satisfied. Each bite felt like a new culinary adventure, and the attention to detail was impeccable"

I highly recommend coming here if you've got something special to celebrate and enjoy.\n\nThe four course meal left me very full and very satisfied.  The granny smith dessert was divine  and I would order it again in a heartbeat.\n\nI found the pork more enjoyable than the ribeye, but that could just be me.  The way the beans blended with the savory meat was awesome.\n\nThe house version of an old fashioned was very drinkable and I probably shouldn't have ordered  so many."

Great date night spot or for special occasions. Takes a few hours to enjoy the full meal experience. Oh, they also have great cocktails, and I always get a white chocolate mocha with the chocolate fondue. So yummy!"

Called the restaurant, the man who answered the phone was really nice and offered to push our reservation 15 mins forward. Once we arrived, we realized we would prefer patio seating and asked if that was possible. The host was also very nice, polite and accommodating. We got seated in the patio with a minimal wait time.\n\nThe highlight of our reservation (besides the yummy food of course) had to be our amazing server, Julian. He was super attentive, very friendly and highly knowledgeable about the menu, suggesting what paired well with what (for my 2 friends, it was their first time eating here and they had lots of questions). I really want to commend Julian for providing outstanding service despite being really busy taking care of multiple tables. We had a great time, my friends loved the restaurant and the food was delicious. Thank you Julian for being awesome! :)\n\nOverall, highly recommend this restaurant!"

The house Benedict \u201cfusion\u201d with a crispy kale and it took half the space of the plate. And the stem of it is not chewable at all, don\u2019t get the point of this dish. The loco moco was also weird and took waaaaay tooo long to come, that\u2019s also why they offered the discount and free waffle. The loco moco also doesn\u2019t look like the other one we use to have and had a huge portion of rice.\n\nTo really find some positive things: bacon in my Benedict tasktes food and the place is clean."

He gave great recommendations, service was on point. I really dislike when we people bring out apps and food way too fast so I asked him to stagger it and he timed everything so perfectly! I loved the ceviche pisco was soooooo good! The Loma saltado had great flavor. The empanadas were so good too. The ahi tuna app was so tender, I wish it was a little less sweet but it was delicious. The whole experience was so enjoyable. The music was really good. The pisco passionfruit drink was great and I especially loved the passionfruit mojito was to die for. Thank you Eduardo, you were such a delight!"

The atmosphere is casual and lively but clean and nice. You could be a teenage high school student,  or a CEO and feel right at home at the tables here either way.\n\nThere's a bar with all kinds of craft brews on tap, too. Would be a nice low-key spot to catch a taste with a few friends in the evening or get wasted at lunchtime watching your team lose the game.\n\nAll in all, this is a burger joint with great burgers and if that isn't what's beautiful about America I don't know what is."

No rice. Small would be an understatement. Husband owner charged me $1 for hot sauce after all payment. The chicken curry was actually delicious. But also very salty. I think she mistook spicy request for salty."

I really love my pizza, but I dislike it when the pizza is too oily or soggy from too many toppings. The \"combo\" pizza has a great deal of toppings, it makes the pizza look heavy, but to my surprise the crust was nice and crispy, there was not too much oil and all the toppings were fully cooked. The extra cheese on top is also a nice addition as well.\n\nIts a bit empty and spacious at 3 pm. This goes for both indoor and outdoor seating. Outdoor seating was especially pleasant with the 70 degree weather.\n\nMy only qualm with Jake's of Saratoga is the outdoor seating states no pets on the patio. So unfortunately you may not be able to bring man's best friend here."

The combination pizza is piled high and very satisfying.\nBooths, tables, and outdoor seating options.\nSeveral TVs with a variety of games on, but the volume is not too loud so you can still have a conversation.\nEveryone who works there is personable and cares about the customer experience."

Hands down some of the best food I have ever had the privilege of indulging in. The owner personally came to our table and, upon learning it was our first time at her establishment, proceeded to grant us a personal tour of her distinguished, personally arranged formal dining room. She spoke with an air of loving pride about the hand-picked chandelier from Prague and the marvelous painting by a local patron which represents many important people in her life. We watched as she interacted with the other diners as well. It was a tremendous gift to have chosen this place to dine. Every single morsel, from the French Onion Soup and Seafood Crepe to the fresh bread and Chicken Forestiere, was a showcase in beautiful culinary execution. All that we experienced was provided for an extremely reasonable price (much more so than many \u201ccookie cutter\u201d chain restaurants) and delivered with a superior standard of quality. Many thanks for reminding your guests of what life-memory dining is really about. If you like this review, let me know with a thumbs up :)"

The vibe was great with nice music.\n\nWe ordered the hummus with chicken which  i definitely recommend. Chicken was juicy and tender. The hummus was the OG kind. Mediterranean pasta wasn\u2019t the best, I\u2019ve had better.\n\nFinally, the show stopper was the lamb ribblets!! Absolutely tasty and tender with the mansaf sauce. I would definitely recommend this place for a nice dinner or even a date night."

Meat for mansaf need to cook in aged yoghurt sauce and served with rice and pine nuts but the items they served not come closers to any where. Never come back and ever recommend"

Honestly, you can't go wrong with anything on their menu. My personal favorites are the Emerald Chili Chicken and the salt and pepper fish\u2014they are absolutely divine! The staff is incredibly friendly and welcoming, creating a warm atmosphere.  The recent renovations have also made the space even more beautiful.

The restaurant provides a separate vegetarian menu, which was a welcome addition.\n\nWe began our meal with Fresh Sesame Rolls and Fried Tofu as appetizers, along with a rich and aromatic coconut milk soup. The soup was not only generously portioned but also expertly seasoned and well-balanced in flavor. While I typically enjoy tofu but do not consider it a favorite, the Fried Tofu at this restaurant was outstanding\u2014one of the best appetizers I have ever had. For the main course, we opted for Pineapple Fried Rice and Panang Curry. The fried rice was fragrant, slightly sweet, and loaded with fresh ingredients, while the Panang Curry was a perfect harmony of rich, creamy coconut milk and bold, aromatic spices. Together, they created a beautifully balanced and deeply satisfying meal.\n\nBeyond the excellent cuisine, the restaurant had a warm ambience and a welcoming staff, making for an enjoyable visit. If you appreciate authentic Thai cuisine, I highly recommend this restaurant."

Specializing in miishien, a type of Yunnan-style rice noodle, this spot offers a rich and flavorful dive into Chinese regional cuisine that\u2019s both comforting and exciting.\nThe star of the show was the Wagyu Beef Cross-Bridge Miishien \u2013 incredibly tender slices of wagyu beef paired with a savory broth that had clearly been simmered to perfection. The broth had layers of flavor, and the noodles had that perfect silky-chewy texture. For those who love a little heat, the Small Pot Spicy Ground Pork Miishien hits the spot without overwhelming your palate."

The ingredients were fresh, and the portion size was just right. I especially loved the pickled vegetables and the variety of toppings available. The staff were friendly and the service was fast. I\u2019ll definitely come back again!"

We had 2 kids with us (2 and a 5 year old) and they were pretty happy with the food as well. Pictured are the macaroni and cheese classic, fish and chips, kids chicken tenders and a kids hot dog.  Pretty straightforward menu of American food and a good vibe inside.  Will definitely be bringing the family back"

It had such an unsavory taste to it.\n\nI got the Muffuletta, which was okay hence the two stars.\n\nThe Charbroiled oysters came out to the size of one oyster I\u2019d get in New Orleans and with 1/10 the flavor and sauciness\u2026$18???? what a rip off. I can get a dozen oysters there for $25. If I were them I\u2019d cut the pricing down to $10 . I can get an oyster for $2 each from my local seafood store and they taste great. At local Oyster bars around here we get 4-6 for less than $18 dollars\n\nThe beignets and here is what really made me decide I just had to leave a review. I\u2019ve eaten beignets all over New Orleans, and I tell you what, if people were served these there, this restaurant would be shut down.\n\nService was mid and they forgot we even wanted beignets when they were about to hand us the check, even though they asked us if the beignets should come after the main course and we said yes\n\nThey were soggy and undercooked, and in fact were so bad I decided to book a trip back to New Orleans to cleanse my pallet with authentic beignets."

After bringing the food, the waitress never showed up to check on us.\nThe plus side\u2026 the restaurant is in a nice court yard and we can bring our dog with us.\nFinally when she brought us the bill, we told her about the tofu salad, she was rude and told me we were the first one to complain about the tofu.

This makes for a cute date spot and has vibrant energy, but I would recommend making a reservation as it fills up well.\n\nI\u2019m rating 3 stars as a warning though for any future diners to not get bullied like we did. Our server added things to our tab that we didn\u2019t order, but did so in a way that made it seem as though it was complimentary. So this is just a heads up to not be foolish like me who blindly paid without looking and check the tab.\n\nThe focaccia was wonderful though!"

Try the rice biwls (Donburi) or the stone pot rice combinations (Meshi) for a fulfilling, crackling delicious meal. Yes there can be a little wait on a busy weekend evening, just know that."

The strange thing was that many customers were leaving after finishing their meals, and there were many empty seats, but they didn't let the waiting customers in. After a couple who were in waiting group went in, my husband checked again, and the male staff member said that the only tables left were bar tables and guided us to them. There were a few groups of people who arrived just before we went in, and it was unpleasant to see them all being guided to their tables. The meal wasn't bad, but among them, the green tea chicken was the worst.  I don't think I'll visit again."

The atmosphere inside is also very nice, with dark furniture that give a cozy atmosphere even with many people inside. It's a great place for an authentic taste of China for a good price. I'm a noodle soup person, so my personal recommendation is their pork belly noodles; even the smell of that soup can make my mouth water! Bring your friends to share a generous pot of hot chrysanthemum tea to wash it all down."

We kinda wished that there could be more customized seasoning for the soup but it tasted good. We ordered half a duck but there were two legs! Very rare to see when we order half, but very nice and generous of this restaurant!\n\nThe restaurant itself was small and seats were limited.

        "comment": "This is an Omikaze which is a boiled dish restaurant. The emphasis is on a light cuisine and sashimi. There is an open kitchen view; you can sit at the counter or at a table. The atmosphere is supposed to have a local and small-community feel. The restaurant gave us a Midnight Diner (on Netflix) aura.\n\nYou have the option of choosing your own courses or try a Kaiseki which are a set series of dishes that the Chef has chosen to tell a story with particularly paired flavor profiles.\n\nWe chose our own dishes:\nPork Belly with Black Vinegar (highly recommend, so flavorful that I ordered seconds), Box Sushi with Salmon (Chef Suzuki swapped in a fatty salmon because my girlfriend had frequented the restaurant before), Mushroom select soup (very light), Chazuke Rice in Broth with Scorched Rice and Sauteed Konbu Kelp (leathery kelp that has a great consistency and mouth feel) with Spinach. We also tried the Beef Gyoza which was also very flavorful with the right amount of crisp.\n\nI also had a nice imported Japanese beer and a lemony dessert sake.\n\nCarbs/fried options are recommended to go at the end because they fill you up and take away from the flavor profile of other dishes if you fill yourself up first.\n\nIt can be a bit pricey, but that is expected with rampant inflation and price gouging across the United States. Also, their choice of ingredients and imported alcohol is not incredibly cheap.\n\nDespite some of the overly critical and pretentious reviews that I have seen of this place, I would recommend at least trying it out, being nice and respectful (that goes a long way), and having an open mind about the chef\u2019s approach, history, storytelling, and journey.\n\nChef Suzuki and staff were explicitly kind and accommodating to us even with 3 other tables while we were there. If you come enough times and get to know him, then you will have a chance to write on the wall and have a specially prepared meal in the back room with him. See the attached picture of the art on the wall that Chef Suzuki did himself."

Like the thick springy noodles which also had the nice amount of chewy consistency.\nThe chashu pork in it were soft and had a slight sweet flavor.  Also fave a whole seasoned egg and a shrimp tempura in it.  The egg had a sweet jelly yolk.\nIf you prefer a sweeter Udon dish the Beef Sukiyaki  Udon would be the a good choice.\nThe Assorted Tempura had 3 shrimp, and 4 different veg and a squid tempura.  Sauce was light with traditional soy sweet flavor.\nPrice was reasonable for the quality of ingredients.\nFood came out quickly.  Staff were attentive."

It was not very busy.\nFood was pretty good but it did take a while to get it prepared, which I put down to the lack of other patrons, they had to make the food rather than having items ready to go.\nOverall, we like the food and would definitely consider stopping by again.  It makes a change from McDonalds across the way especially since their prices have gone up."

I thought they were very mild, and that was perfect for our youngest as she is not too keen on spicy food. In the end, I end up using the tomato-based to cook a bunch of seafood items. The abalone was fantastic and so was the shrimp paste. The oysters and scallops were also very tasty and fresh. From the veggie sides, the fried tofu and the oyster mushrooms were my favorites. My children loved all they ate. Next time I plan to come here and try the non-veggie broths with a selection of meats. Great service and ambiance as well."

They have a self-serve station with all kinds of sauces and condiments, side dishes, fruits, and even deserts. If you aren\u2019t used to eating spicy foods I would recommend the Pork Bone broth, but if you are a Chinese Mala enjoyer I definitely recommend their signature spicy soup base. The meat is high quality and delicious as well as all the other ingredients we ordered. Highly recommend!"

Some of the other Mendocino Farms are in crowded shopping complexes where even doing curbside makes one feel guilty.\n\nThe food is consistent with the other locations. The decor is the same too with the standard blue cow and grass seats.\n\nThe most horrible thing is that they discontinued all the good salads on the menu like Save Drake's Salad \ud83e\udd57 and Impossible Taco Salad. Not this particular chains fault but it does bring their food taste down to a 4-star. I tried two of their other salads and they are a solid 3 stars.\n\nThe hummus wrap was delightful though. The tortilla was perfectly chewy."

Cute homey feel inside\nService: 4 - Attentive and friendly staffs\nFood: 3 - Maybe my expectations were high but it fell short. Don't get me wrong, the Hush Puppies were scrumptious! Crunchy exterior with grittiness of the corn meal - sauce on the bottom and some sort of butter? Yes, please. The Short Rib Bites were also tender but it was too little. \ud83d\ude2c The Fried Chicken Sando was where it fell short. We got cut in half and I somehow ended up with all of the breading, which wasn't crispy one bit and just sloppy\nDrink: 4.5 - Would come back to try other drinks once the menu is rotated\n\nWould I come back?

Every dish was fresh, with many ingredients sourced from Japan. Particularly delightful was the fresh and sweet sea urchin imported from Japan. Each course provided both visual and gustatory enjoyment, and we had a delightful dining experience. Since it was my birthday, they even presented a beautiful plate with exquisite desserts \u2013 a thoughtful gesture that made the experience truly fantastic! It\u2019s indeed a remarkable Kaiseki restaurant."

Book on OpenTable to snag a spot.\n\ud83d\udccd14417 Big Basin Way, Saratoga\nThis was actually my second time here - first time was back when they were in Burlingame. Gotta say, I preferred the OG spot. More food, longer experience, you know how it is.\n\ud83c\udf76Every time I do omakase or kaiseki, I swear it's like a spa day for my taste buds. Perfect recharge after traveling!\nHighlights:\nJw5 aperitif sake to kick things off\nODash appetizer soup served in a wine glass - looks like white wine but packs a punch with that 5-year aged broth\nSakizuke tofu with fish roe - silky smooth tofu + salty roe = happy mouth\nOtsukuri sashimi - fresh but nothing mind-blowing\nYakiMono grilled eel - salt-cured eel with morels was \ud83d\udc4c\nSunoMono seafood jelly salad - my fave! Creamy yam, shrimp, uni, edible flowers. Texture for days.\nSeasonal Gohan - Hokkaido A5 wagyu over rice. Tiny portion but that certificate-worthy beef tho!\nDesserts were on point - loved the caramel mochi cake with soy milk powder\nOverall, presentation was fire and the vibe was transporting. Wish there was a bit more food and some bolder flavors, but still a solid kaiseki experience. Who's ready for their omakase fix?"

The large outside dining perimeter is a special touch since most Los Gatos restaurants are lucky to even have sidewalk space for outdoor tables. The old Victorian building is charming, iconic & drips with \"high tea\" interior decor... perfect for a weekend brunch. The music is lively, the bar area is comfortable with several chic sofas to lounge on. The service is good but slow. The food...it was divine (incredible quality & presentation)! And the coffee menu, well let's just say this coffee snob was fervently impressed! Well done, Gardenia."

The mesquite grilled dishes at Dio Deka are particularly good. We have their lamb chops before but this time we had the Branzino and the Wagyu short ribs. Baklava for desert and chicken kebabs and the pita play for appetizers"

A couple of us had the Arni Youvetsi \"lamb volcano shank\", which was delicious and a sizeable portion. We also had the lobster pasta, which was great as well (as long as you don't mind looking at a lobster head \ud83d\ude0b ); rich and creamy sauce. Marco was an amazing server and gave great guidance on both food and drink.\nI haven't been here for a few years, but I have to come back sooner."

The chicken kabobs and koobideh was very moist and juicy. They know how to cook their meat well. This place deserves more love, go check it out."

We ordered\n\nFried Calamari\nMargarita Pizza\nSceriffo non Perdona\nAmerican\nCrema Catalana\n\nIn the beginning we were very impressed with the efficiency of the service, we got our appetizer, bread, pizza, pasta, American very less waiting time. My husband enjoyed the pizza, while I didn't enjoy the tomato sauce much - I thought it wasn't the classic style of the margarita flavor. I enjoyed the one I ordered, though. There's a hint of spiciness, the creaminess of the yolks is great, and the pancetta and the rest of the ingredients went along with the overall flavor. We thought the fried calamari was too greasy, but we really liked the lightly battered style. The intensity of the coffee was excellent, and even though we ordered Americano, we asked the server to make it with less water so that we could still taste the intensity and boldness of the coffee.\n\nWhen it came to our dessert, this was the longest one we had to wait for, perhaps around 10 minutes. Even though it wasn't that busy, the server told us they were pretty packed, which caused the delay. Despite that, we enjoyed the creaminess and smooth texture of the crema, melting smoothly in our mouth - just that it was not warm anymore when it was served to us.\n\nOverall, we\u2019re pleased with the professionalism of the staff and the taste of their dishes, coffee, and dessert. We're happy to visit again and try other things on their menu."

It has quite nice decor, a cool blend of hip with a touch of modern rustic class.\n\nBut service was slow and we felt unattended all evening. From ordering to food to water to the bill. When the waitress WAS with us, she was quite nice and attentive though. But still, wasn\u2019t expecting an hour and a half dinner on a Monday.\n\nFood was hit or miss. Oysters, risotto scallops, and octopus were good. Chicken liver mousse was an odd combination of flavors IMO. The sweetness overpowered the savory pate characteristic. The burger was average at best. I\u2019ve had the same at my favorite restaurant (Forthright, now closed) which used to be a sister place to here. Seemed better there. And the seafood bucatini noodles were really undercooked. Not even al dente but kind of doughy. I dunno, I was expecting so much more for the price and since they are related to Forthright."

We tried the dragon balls (special of the night), octopus, beef skewers, pan con tomate and the torrija for dessert. The food was good but didn\u2019t blow us away. We were happy with everything we ordered."

Like many tapas places and like most things Los Gatos, the prices are elevated, but still a great spot for a date and special occasion. Note: the menu is from Aug 2024"

The weather was favorable so we opted for outdoor in the semi-covered patio. Things we liked about the food & drink: lovely amuse-bouche lentil soup, varied wine list and choices by the glass, moist-cooked grilled meats, lovely sauces and dips. The one improvement would be for the dessert. (Lots of honey but not a strong pistachio flavor) Service was truly acting as host of a home, educating us on the owners, their intention and vibe. I can just picture this being a great dinner hangout.  I would like to return for dinner."

We had a couple of non-alcoholic beers, which is nice to see amongst the other drinks.\n\nThe staff were attentive and we had a table outside overlooking the street. In a strange coincidence, we commented on how similar the menu, pizza choices and actual pizza was similar to State of Mind in Los Altos. Turns out the owners know one another.\n\nThoroughly enjoyed our lunch and look forward to returning. \ud83c\udf55\ud83c\udf7b\ud83e\udd57"

They offer absolutely delicious, woodfired pizza, amazing cocktails, and a great experience all around. The highlight here is definitely the pizza and the location is in downtown Los Gatos. There is some beautiful outdoor and indoor seating as well.\n\nThe pizza was absolutely amazing. We ended up getting a barbecue chicken pizza which had a sauce that was made out of a mustard and barbecue base. It was incredible. We chopped it off with the draft beer, and I got an oak and rye cocktail, which was absolutely to die for.\n\nThe prices here are fair and the service is fast. From the moment we sat down we were served in about three minutes and our food came out in about 15. We had enough time to drink, relax, and wait for the amazing food.\n\nThe service was friendly, we were able to find seats very easily, and it was just an overall good experience.\n\nI\u2019m I\u2019m adding this to my list of the best pizza in the Bay Area by far"

The IPAs were the highlight, with excellent flavor, and the Oktoberfest Lager was also really good! However, we weren\u2019t fans of the Cougar Juice, as it lacked taste. While the drinks were great, the food is definitely pricey\u2014$15 for a pretzel feels like a whole meal price. Overall, a nice place for good beer and vibes, but be prepared for higher food costs."

It's the kind of place that sticks to the basics\u2014think fries, Caesar salad, a nicely cooked steak, and grilled fish. The food is reliably good, though it doesn't offer much in the way of surprises or culinary innovation. If you're after a meal that's comforting and straightforward, this spot will do the trick. Just don't expect to be wowed by any bold flavors or unique dishes. In short, it's a decent option for a simple, no-frills dining experience."

There's enough cheese to cover the bread and two apples they provided. There were some vegetables but again, not enough cheese\n\nRestaurant wasn't overly busy but the service was glacial.\n\nIt was a little strange at the time that our waiter didn't take main course orders when we were first ordering. Glad he didn't.\n\nOne fondue appetizer and a single serving of wine $45 before tip.\n\nAnother oddity was the service. There was a male host downstairs that helped us out and was very nice. Upstairs there was a lady who was maybe a host but ignored us until we walked around and found someone to help. That same lady was greeting local/regular customers, seating them and seemed to have an entirely different quality of service for people she knew. These customers were getting food and drinks really quickly."

So, whether it\u2019s authentic Italian food is uncertain. The location is tucked away in an unassuming corner surrounded by outdoor decorations, making it easy to miss if not recommended by someone. Personally, I really enjoyed their Cacio e Pepe (I might have misspelled it). Their appetizer sampler is also highly recommended."

There are a lot of regulars here so they tend to be very chatty with them and it\u2019s hard to get their attention. But other than that, this place is great to sit at the bar and enjoy a glass of wine and some meats and cheeses."

There is plenty of parking in the back. The inside interior is beautiful and great for a date.\n\nI love their Iced Coconut Vietnamese coffee! It has fresh shredded coconut on top. I wish it was a bigger size for the price though. We also tried their Banh Xeo tacos. It's pretty good size for one person each.  It comes with good sauce.  We had their Loco Moco which was good. We also liked their Pho Poutine which was beef with  curly steak like fries. We had a dessert to complete our meal. The Coconut Pandan Pann Cotta was excellent and smooth. Not too sweet either.\n\nService was great as well as the food. I would definitely come back to try their additional dishes especially their Ube Pancakes. I would recommend this place to try if you're in the area."

By the time 9AM rolled around, there were only two other parties.\n\nThe decor is very nice and classy. We ordered the pho poutine, the resting brunch face (chicken and waffles) and the pork belly fried rice. The poutine was such a large serving for it to be a starter! We ended up eating so much poutine we barely touched our mains. The chicken for the chicken and waffles were saltier than I would like, but the pandan waffle was nice. We were disappointed the orange juice wasn\u2019t fresh squeezed.\n\nNot sure we would make a dedicated trip out here, but definitely worth a stop if driving by!"

It featured very crispy iceberg lettuce topped with grilled chicken, blue cheese dressing, cucumber slices, and boiled eggs. The presentation was also quite inviting, adding to the overall appeal of the dish.\n\nThe kids had a great time with their meals too. They enjoyed both the chicken and steak tacos, which were tasty and well-prepared. The guacamole was made to order and tasted very fresh, which we all appreciated.\n\nIn summary, it\u2019s a nice spot for Mexican food near downtown Los Gatos. While it didn't blow us away, it was still a good experience, and we\u2019ll likely visit again."

I know the crescent cake with vanilla ice cream was the best thing I have ever eaten ever in my life.\n\nUpdate: while Manresa has closed, the staff of Ritual at Manresa keep the dream alive. Every month a new chef brings their creativity and excellence to share their specialty with those lucky enough to reserve. We've attended two of the recent meals and were amazed by both, but I was completely blown away by tonight's trout and wine pairing. Absolutely sublime pairing.\n\nIf you get a chance and want to really treat yourself or that special someone, reserve a meal here. You won't be disappointed ."

I believed, like other dinners of this caliber I might take a photo with the chef, give him a gift, and possibly have him sign something. I paid $1,000 per person.\nI was very upset to learn that Chef Alex was in Brazil. He is/was not present at the restaurant for his whole last week at Ritual. It\u2019s like buying Taylor Swift concert tickets and her understudy\u2019s understudy performs. It\u2019s not the same, it\u2019s false advertising. His sous chef was the one who was responsible for our meal.\nI even asked to switch to a meal he was cooking, and was turned down."

The dining area was spotless, with tables and chairs meticulously arranged and free of any debris. The floors were well-maintained, and the overall ambiance was inviting and comfortable. The restrooms were also exceptionally clean, which added to our positive experience.\n\nThe staff at Kamakura took great care in ensuring that all surfaces were regularly sanitized, and we noticed them frequently cleaning high-touch areas. This attention to detail made us feel safe and well-cared for during our visit. The presentation of the food was also impeccable, with each dish served on clean and attractive tableware. The overall cleanliness of the restaurant contributed significantly to our enjoyment of the meal.\n\nIn addition to the cleanliness, the quality of the food and the friendly service made our visit to Kamakura a memorable one. We highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a clean and welcoming dining environment with delicious Japanese cuisine."

I believe this place is overlooked due to the bar, but the restaurant portion of the establishment is truly phenomenal. Come here if you\u2019re looking to be fulfilled and satisfied with your meal, there has not been one time so far that I have had a bad experience with the food or attentive people that work here. I truly appreciate the environment that makes up the inside of the place, lots of awesome memorabilia of Italian portrayal. I typically go in the morning generally around when they open for business, it\u2019s laid back and relaxing to enjoy such a delicious meal. The owner Pete is always so kind and makes sure we\u2019re satisfied with what we have received. Jeff the waiter is also attentive, kind, and super responsive. This place is truly a hole in the wall amongst the many restaurants along the strip, make sure to come here!"

My mole chicken enchiladas were tasty and the sangria is a fav.\nSince we ate inside without the dog recently I got to admire some of the details in the mural along the wall.  I liked the lamp integrated into the mural.\nNot in my photo, but look for Wile E Coyote somewhere nearby."

Chunks of avocado, creamy feta cheese, tomatoes round out the ingredients.  My wife and I drive 30 minutes each way weekly to enjoy a lunch or dinner salad.  You can also try their scrumptious grilled chicken torta (sandwich) on a perfect roll and a side of the aforementioned salad.  Their chips and homemade salsas are outstanding.  Wonderful fresh fruit drinks and made-to-order churros rounds out what is always a great meal!  The Andale mother ship is based in Los Gatos, but you can also find outlets at both the SF and Oakland airports."

Loved the chicken egg roll, which tastes surprisingly light and clean as egg rolls. My partner got a great Hendrick Martini and I asked for a Roku Gin Sour, which is not on the menu, and the bartender crafted both of them perfectly. Brandon, our waiter, was very pleasant and attentive. we had a lovely time and will return."

Our outdoor table was comfortably heated on a cold rainy evening.\n\nStarted with a couple of cocktails and an appetizer. Anchovies with buttered crostini was something new and loved it. Barraco's pappardelle with mushroom ragu was very good. Olive breadcrumbs added a nice texture to the dish. Now the salmon, which I'm very particular about, was the best salmon I'd ever had (even better than mine). The skin was crispy and seasoned perfectly. The meat was medium-rare and just melted in my mouth. The sauce brought all the flavors together. We were also happy with the Pavlova, of which I'm also particular. The pastry chef came to our table to discuss the details of his creation.\n\nCan't wait to go back for more."

We suggested to pay the same amount of tip he didn\u2019t do that. Even for paying with multiple cards we had to discuss a lot!\nThe signs and guides on the menu were not very correct: biryani was not marked as spicy while it was very spicy."

The food was beautifully laid out in tasteful serve ware, and tasted great. They brought out papad and dips to start, and then we got the chili paneer appetizer which was delicious. For our mains we got mango chicken, chicken tikka masala and rice. We tried the Asiago pesto naan just for fun since it\u2019s pretty unusual to see that on a menu, and it was good although I enjoyed my lachha paratha a lot more. For dessert I tried the Himalayan khuwa, which I\u2019ve only eaten a handful of times before and it was good. We had a lovely evening."

Stop complicating our lives and simply adjust your menu prices to properly pay your staff.\nI had chicken with rice and vegetables and the rice had uncooked kernels in it. 20% tip was automatically added so with tax and fees my $12 beer became a $16 beer. I had their featherweight entre (a piece of chicken, a little bit of rice, and a little mixed vegetables) and one beer and my bill was $47. I left still hungry."

This is more like a taproom, and they have beer from a variety of different local breweries. You can even buy beer to go. Hi Lou recommended especially if you\u2019re going to be doing Los Gatos for a day, we started here and ended up walking up the street to try different places.\n\nThere\u2019s not a lot of seating, but there\u2019s enough to accommodate most people. There\u2019s indoor and outdoor seating. We ended up sitting outdoor and this was pretty cool because we could see all the traffic going into Los Gatos and got to people watch while drinking beer. It was a kinda nice experience.\n\nThe service was extremely friendly and super knowledgeable about all the different beer that they had to offer. There\u2019s something for everyone here. They have ciders, IPAs, loggers, and other offerings.\n\nHighly recommend recommended. We just came here for a beer, but I could easily see me returning and grabbing a few more."

For our entr\u00e9e, we had the Icnik (lamb shank), which was incredibly tender and delicious, served with a side of barley that had a pleasant, whey-like sourness. The cherry on top of our dinner was the Ekmek Kadayifi with ice cream\u2014a true masterpiece. The cream inside the toasted bread was rich, buttery, and perfectly sweetened.

When your place is small, and you play your music too loud, then all your diners are going to have to raise their voices and suddenly it's so loud that the experience can be unpleasant. Secondly, I would have asked to be seated outside for a more pleasant experience as the place had many tables available, however, they only had one space heater for the entire outdoor seating. That didn't make sense to me because they were packed/full inside, and more tables could have been booked for a cozy experience outside. Invest in space heaters, you will fill the tables."

We sat outside, and the atmosphere was absolutely lovely\u2014perfect for a relaxed and enjoyable evening.\n\nOur server was quick, attentive, and super friendly, making the experience even better. We started with two appetizers, followed by three incredible pizzas: Margherita, Vegetable Pesto, and Mediterranean. Each one was absolutely delicious, with fresh ingredients and amazing flavors!\n\nThis place is a true gem, and I can\u2019t recommend it enough. We\u2019ll definitely be back! \ud83c\udf55"

        "comment": "Danbi is a delightful new addition to the downtown neighborhood that just did a \"soft launch\" less than a week ago. They don't have signage or interior design completed yet, but they DO have delicious, authentic Korean fare under the careful eye of owner/operator and deliberate chef, Sunny. She claimed it was \"just simple fare\", but we very much appreciated the thought and careful consideration of all her choices.\n\nWe tried the seafood pancake and basic fried chicken with a pot of jasmine green tea and were pleasantly surprised by the variety of flavors and textures. The pancake was out of this world - thick and hearty in the middle, loaded with seafood and absolute crunchy perfection on the outside. The chicken was also so sharply crispy all over and super moist in the middle. You might think two fried dishes would leave us feeling heavy, but the ultra fresh fermented or barely-blanched veggie banchan left us with such cleansed palates that we felt great even after eating all the generous portions. The dressings and sauces were spiced and salted *just right*, so it didn't leave us feeling like we had overeaten or had a post-salt thirst. The spices never overpowered the flavor of the ingredients, allowing us to really experience the freshness of everything in each dish.\n\nSmall details also made a big difference - the fried foods and cold dishes are served in hollow, insulated stainless steel plates, so the crispy fried foods remained piping hot even seated next to an open door on this blustery, stormy day. It wasn't a race against time to get to all the hot food first because it just ...stayed hot and crispy... which wouldn't be the case if it were served in standard stoneware. What a delight. Clearly this is just second nature to her and she takes her own fine taste for granted.\n\nWe can't wait for other neighbors to try out this new spot and get to know more of the beautiful creations on her menu, especially as the weather warms up and she's able to open the patio soon.\n\nThank you Sunny for sharing your own bright spot in the heart of town!"

Once I chose my food, it took me maybe two minutes to pay and have the order go through. Even though it said it would be 15 to 30 minutes, it only took what felt like 5 to 7 minutes to be ready. Since I was taking out, I didn't have a lengthy exchange with any staff, but the young man who did greet me seemed friendly and happy. Furthermore, the chicken tenders were some of the best I've had. The meat maybe wasn't super seasoned, but it tasted like good quality chicken, and most of all the breading had a really nice texture. It was super crispy but not dry. I love that it was more similar to a fish and chips batter. Everything tasted fresh and I would happily eat there again :-)"

The kimchi was done of the best I've ever had and figured it had to be homemade due to texture and freshness of the cabbage. I asked a server, and she confirmed it was homemade. The soup was very good.  But I was very impressed with the beef and broccoli.  The broccoli was cooked perfectly al dente and hot as it should be ! The beef was tender and flavorful.  The chow mein was very good and flavorful for just being a vegetable chow mein. Everything was very good,  if you live in this area make sure you come eat here !!

Pretty much everything was great except maybe the octopus which was just OK. Since these are small plates, I suggest you also get the lamb chops - served with their wonderfully crispy fries! They only have one dessert (I think) but it too was great. Service was wonderful - the waitress took the time to explain every single thing on the menu, and service was prompt and attentive. Highly recommend."

Sometimes if you become a regular you can ask one or two weeks in advance to see if chef Hector is willing to make one hit of his amazing paellas. These are not on the menu so you definitely would have to reserve in advance. Otherwise the menu is always absolutely fantastic. Try the pinchos. Try the main dishes such as lamb or beef or octopus. When peppers are on the menu try those as well.\n\nSpecials are on the menu when there is something in season or chef Hector is moved to try out a new dish. Come regularly to see what's new.\n\nPersonal favorites include the house made potato chips that are served with the meat dishes, huevos con jamon, and Spanish tortillas.\n\nIf you enjoy wine, they have quite a nice selection of Spanish wines, including cavas and tempranillos. They are always willing to discuss your princes and see how well they can match your preferred wine.\n\nI don't usually write this kind of review and recommendation because I always want to make sure that whoever comes to what I recommend will have the kind of experience that I describe. In this case, I cannot recommend highly enough. If you love this type of Spanish food, this is the place to go."

Pedro\u2019s wasn\u2019t exactly a dining destination before they re-opened last year, but the new ownership and Chef has reinvented the place and the food is definitely worth driving out of the way for. You can taste the high-quality ingredients and the care in the cooking and presentation. Can\u2019t wait to go back and try more!"

FYI, the portion are very large so 1 order will be plenty for 2 because they give chips to begin with and that fill your stomach\ud83d\ude42 plenty of parking spaces outside. Staff is very friendly.

I went inside to check it out and use the restroom since I traveled from almost an hour away. Someone who worked there asked \u201ccan I help you? I said yes, where is the restroom please? He said it was a private event and I couldn\u2019t use it. No big deal however what really left a bad taste in my mouth was that he looked me up and down before saying no. Seriously? Very judgmental. If he would have left it at this is a private event, I would have had no problems leaving but you had to be rude. Disgusting. Be better. Costs $0 to be kind dude."

We had a pitcher of the Cadillac Margarita which comes with a nacho plate (not on the main menu). This was enough appetizer for 5 and there were options for veg and non veg. It was very good. Cheesy. For dinner we had the chipotle burrito, mole enchilada, tacos and chili verde plate. Burrito was ok with not much flavor. However the rest of the food was good. Service was prompt. The back patio is quieter with heat lamps."

I had never made arrangements for a group of 30 before, and the manager, Carlos, helped curate a special, economical dinner which felt quite grand and elegant. I was excited to tell people where we celebrating.\n\nWe walked in to the patio to find a lovely, green space. The table was set with specially printed menus and people were able to pick their starter and main course and enjoy aqua fresca and/or iced tea/lemonade and dessert. I was expecting buffet trays but everyone got beautifully plated dishes, which made the dinner more formal. People LOVED the food. I got the salmon and it was incredibly flavorful and a great portion size - I need to return for more salmon.\n\nThe amazing food, drinks, set-up, service,  and the lovely patio space made the evening feel perfect and elegant. This is a great place to make fond memories for important occasions."

The place was reasonably priced.\n\nPro-tip: Walk across the street, to stroll on Los Gatos creek trail next to water stream after breakfast, stay healthy.\n\n- Ordered Banana Nutella (Churro) Waffle, replaced the Churro waffle with a regular one\n\n- The waffle was perfect, not soggy, the bananas were fresh and they didn\u2019t overdo the Nutella. Comes with a hot syrup on the side, great combo, makes the waffle less dry and tasty. I needed an extra of syrup, provided at not extra cost.\n\n- They don\u2019t have freshly squeezed regular fruit juice which was a bummer. They have \u2018Juiced\u2019 combo vegetable and fruit juices if you\u2019re interested."

We did wait for dinner to order dinner plates to again share. The staff is so friendly and accommodating. Bathrooms are a must to try out. Very clean, stylish and warm. The covered patio seating was comfortable  and a bit cozy but it was good for our large noisy group."

They were very stale and also they were so overly greasy and just...wet, from the garlic paste that kind of looks like it was just lazely splatted in the middle. The garlic paste was way too strong, or like garlicky but not in a good way, tasted like minced garlic straight from the jar that you'd get at the grocery store or something, lol. The fish burger also was alright. It was a little bland and just didn't really have anything too special about it, but it was still good. The two things I think were really good though were the chili and especially the pizza. The chili wasnt too spicy or anything and i think had a really good savory meaty flavor and it was nice. The pizza was also super yummy, probably some of the best pizza Ive had actually, the crust was a little crispy yet still soft and moist in some places, and the cheese was really stretchy and melty! I feel there was a nice balance between the tomato sauce and the cheese, and it was just all around really good. This place can definitely get a little bit loud, it was kind of hard to hear what the people on the other side of our table were saying. They do have a fun little arcade area with claw machines and other stuff that could be fun for the kids. Food didn't take too long to come out either. So yah If you come here, they do have good pizza, but Id probably just STICK to the pizza, lol."

Only for it to open more locations in the East Bay Area that were closer for me to visit.\n\nLike in the reviews I've written for other locations, the food here is good, tasty, juicy and they serve grass fed beef, along with a multitude of other organic ingredients! Love it! Makes it that much easier to want to have it.\n\nAnd like all the other locations, the homemade pickles are deeeelicious! Hmmmmm, mmmmm, mmmm.\n\nFor this visit, my cousin was kind and generous enough to treat me to a meal AND drive me too! So considerate of her, and good company too.\n\nThis location is a pretty large size, plenty of space and seems to be pretty easy to find a spot to sit down and eat. There is also a foozball table, in case, someone needs to work up their appetite a little more before inhaling their yummy meal! IT's a nice little additive to the rest of the typical restaurant feel.\n\nOne little drawback I found was parking seemed to be a little tight not scarce, just tight spaces, but it could have just seemed that way, b/c it was dark and hard to see."

The food is always fresh and flavorful\u2014burritos, tacos, whatever I\u2019m in the mood for, it always delivers. It\u2019s the kind of place where you know what you\u2019re getting, and it\u2019s always solid.\n\nIt\u2019s super popular with local families, and you can definitely feel that neighborhood energy\u2014especially right after school when it gets packed with kids and parents grabbing a quick bite. I usually try to go just before the rush.\n\nIt\u2019s become a comfort spot for me\u2014reliable, unfussy, and just genuinely good food.

It's high in the woody part of Los Gatos and the lights strung around the winery, grounds, and restaurant are beautiful at night. Super picturesque. Even saw a family of deer in the middle of the road.\n\nThe table service was also quite attentive and good. Friendly. Clear the silverware between apps and meals. Food came for everyone all at once but it took quite some time after ordering even with hardly anyone else in the place.\n\nThe food selection was a little sparse. I was hoping they'd have steak. Since not, I had the pork chop which was quite succulent and tasty with the onions and other garnishing. The burgers and pizza all looked ok but the menu wasn\u2019t special. My vegetarian friend was not able to find anything he liked. Felt sorry for him.\n\nToo full for dessert and anyway, it took so long for the main course we didn't have time for it."

There are always wonderful specials, too! The fish and chips are too quality, the burgers and salads are amazing!! Our favorites are the ahi salad and the Thai chicken salad. All of the desserts are wonderful. Few places does your server hold two Masters in Science! Both regulars and tourists love this place - EVERYONE is welcome!!"

There's only street parking,so we had to walk a bit. Our fault for not doing better research. We were told it would be a while since we needed outside seating. Only ended up waiting 15 minutes. Once seated it took a while for the waiter to appear. It's seems that the brunch menu is cheaper than the regular menu. We ended up ordering a croissant sandwich and a loco moco. Once it arrived the presentation looked great. Alas the taste didn't match the look. My loco moco was bland. The gravy had no flavor at all . The burger was just as bland. No salt or seasonings. My wife's sandwich was just as disappointing. Stale croissant, not really that great. They do have a great patio. We may try it again just to see if it was a off day."

My wife ordered the skirt steak which also was delicious. We also ordered the Louisiana butter cake and I have to stay the food. Here was delicious. The only reason why they didn\u2019t get five stars is because our server Steven only showed up to the table to take our order and that was it. When I did inquire about our server, and if he could come to the table, I was told he was busy, but Presley stepped up to the plate and make sure that our table was taken care of and we got everything we needed.

They informed me they will offer table service in the coming weeks. Although I\u2019m not an expert on Indian cuisine, I\u2019m a huge fan and thrilled to have another option in town.\n\nFor my first visit, I opted for their takeout Chicken Biryani. It was incredibly delicious! The spiced rice was generous, and the three pieces of chicken were perfectly cooked. I\u2019ve only had biryani a few times before, but Azeem\u2019s version was truly a delight.\n\nI\u2019ll definitely be adding Azeem\u2019s to my list of go-to takeout restaurants. I can\u2019t wait to try their in-house dining experience as well."

Part of the masala has medium sized fruit seeds (pits) that add to the flavor ( you don\u2019t eat that ) which really gives a fullness to the flavor along with the other spices. The Butter Chicken (halal preparation) which I personally pour over the Biryani, was equally amazing with a homemade butter sauce that just opens up your flavor buds with a deep mild spice that was just perfect. We also ordered the appetizer Chicken Samosas with the mint chutney that was likely one of the best Samosas I\u2019ve had in the entire Bay Area. To wash it all down I couldn\u2019t resist the Mango Lassi of course."

I went in the morning \ud83c\udf05 when they opened and we're the 1st one there with a few friends.\nWe all ordered the tik Tok sensation that is going viral haha, I found it on IG.\n\nServer was super polite and jokingly friendly which made us relaxed.

I asked for a mocktail version of one of the drinks and the bartender asked if I was set on that because she had other recs for a mocktail. She ended up making me a drink that was not on the menu which was super fun and I really enjoyed \ud83e\udd29 My other friends got the Negroni and the Clover Club and liked both of those. The interior was beautifully designed and there was lots of seating to choose from. We enjoyed the round booth seating where we were at. Towards the end of our time there the music got really really loud and it became kind of hard to hear one another so that was when we decided to wrap up. I am so happy Morgan Hill now has a cocktail bar like this now. I can\u2019t wait for my next visit!"

She genuinely made the night better with her conversation and attention to detail, even when the bar got busier. Her drinks were spot-on every time, and she never missed a beat\u2014except for her salted lemon drop!\n\nShoutout to Brandon for handling a tricky situation with the town weirdo\u2014he acted quickly and professionally to keep the chill vibe intact. Overall, the bar\u2019s atmosphere was fantastic, and the service from both Lexi and Brandon made it a top-notch experience."

I don't drink alcohol and have enjoyed a soda at the bar. Soda   was pricey... $5.00, but it was unlimited soda. Been that way since it opened and up to a few weeks ago.  Tonight I went there had their delicious butter chicken waffle fries and ordered a coke zero... later on in the evening I asked for a refill. When I got my bill... my bill came to $38!  The Butter Chicken was $18.... Turns out they charge $6.00 per drink now for soda!! No refills. At that price I've decided to stop going there. One thing to charge for refills, another thing to make a change without notifying customers.  When I asked the waitress why the prices increased so much,  without any notice she said... \"Inflation\"... Nope.. inflation didn't raise the price of soda up to $6.00/glass. I'd been there several times in the past couple of months. It was a good run. But, I won't return..."

The appetizers were pretty amazing too.\n\nThe Calamari Fritti with lemon, sweet basil syrup, and spicy tomato sauce were delicious and well-portioned. The Burrata con Prosciutto, with fresh burrata cheese, prosciutto, sun-dried tomato pesto, and crostini, was a delightful start to the meal.\n\nOf all the pastas we tried, the Fettuccine al Pescatore was just ok compared to the others, so I'd skip this one. However, the Tortellini con Prosciutto, cheese-filled tortellini with mushrooms, prosciutto, spinach, and cream sauce was absolutely fantastic!\n\nThe Bistecca Quattro Formaggio was another standout, with a rich, creamy flavor that was simply irresistible."

The shrimp had the expected texture.\n\nHowever, the ravioli filling had neither the texture nor the taste of lobster, so I was disappointed.\n\nThe outdoor patio's waterfall was working and added to the ambiance of our dining experience. We were looking for a venue for our 50th anniversary and are considering this location. See attached pictures."

Overall good comfort food.   Service was great.  We came 1/2 hour to closing and they were very accommodating."

Come on the weekends if you want to have a Sunday Funday.\n\nWe also got an Aqua de pi\u00f1a- they offer free refills.\n\nThey have a Oaxacan sample and other typical Oaxacan dishes."

I tasted a tiny amount and didn't touch the rest of the plate. One small burrito was consumed by my spouse from his entree. This was mentioned to them as we were paying the bill and we proceeded to be charged for both. Within 20 minutes my husband was not feeling well and got sick."

Leo and Maria were wonderful!!\n\nI had the Pork Parmesan and New York steak during happy hour and I was blown away by the quality and the portion size! For $14 I expected the happy hour \u201cbites\u201d to be small, so I ordered two - a mistake but also a blessing in disguise since I am now fully convinced that this place is a real gem. The pasta that came with the parm was cooked to perfection, a truly perfect chew which I haven\u2019t experienced in more than a few years. The potato cake that came with the steak was also excellent.\n\nThey can prepare almost every pasta as gluten free, as well as their pizza and multiple desserts. My wife who is gluten-free also enjoyed her meal immensely.\n\nWhat a wonderful restaurant. Service was also excellent and went above and beyond, so friendly and helpful. The whole experience really made my day!"

Gabby the owner was kind, friendly, attentive, and genuinely cared about making my dining experience enjoyable.\n\nLocated in the heart of Morgan Hill, this establishment boasts a fantastic ambiance and easy accessibility with plenty of parking. It\u2019s a great spot to enjoy a meal with friends or just relax and have a cup of coffee with some of their amazing homemade pastries.\n\nI highly recommend the delicious food, outstanding customer service, and a great location.

Reuben's Uncle, Ezra is also excellent especially if you sub the Swiss cheese for habanero jack. Breakfast burritos and house made salsa are awesome as well. A whole glass case full of delicious scones & pastries to finish off your experience. Shout out to Traci. the weekend counter  lady who is friendly and helpful."

Others in our party had pancake stacks. Lots of variety so this is not a typical pancake house. The even have an extensive gluten free menu. Don\u2019t forget to order a tasty mimosa.\nIt was very crowded when we arrived at 11:20. The wait time was 20 minutes which is acceptable. The noise level was very loud and distracting, so much so that we had difficulty hearing our own conversations. Our server was wonderful and took really good care of our needs. You will love it here!! Oh and you can dine inside or outside!!"

I ordered the triple berry pancakes, since I love pancakes,  and they didn't disappoint. The wife had the bacon avocado omelet which she said was pretty good & came w/hashbrowns. The son went the lunch route and had the basic burger w/cheese and fries. He loved the fries but said he didn't like the burger because it was too juicy....make it make sense son!!!

It seems like they have good fish and chips. Based on the reviews, I should have gotten that. I definitely will not be returning to find out.\nUpdate: I had given a 3-star based on the flavor, but after eating the linguini with multiple broken shells, I am just super disappointed. This dinner was an order in for a birthday. Please be careful eating this. At least the seafood quantity was good, and after adding oregano, basil, chili flakes, and some other seasonings, the flavor wasn't terrible. Please do better City Fish."

Not the hole in the wall spots I am used to: There were some of my favorites like a seafood molcajete, Mojarra frita, and tacos de tripa. So we decided on those items except the Mojarra was a la diabla. As a spicy food lover with most places not at all touching my spice limits the Mojarra was the best I've ever had. The tacos de tripa were very good but with the red sauce on the side there a complexity of flavors I have never tasted for such a simple dish. The seafood molcajete was yet another homerun. The sauces here are one of a kind. They are rich, savory, and spicy. I will be coming back again\u2026 and again\u2026 and again. Also, this is at 810 Tennant Station not Tennant Ave. Right next to the theater in the Safeway parking lot. Directions on your phone may lead you behind a church."

The atmosphere was warm and inviting, with a vibrant yet cozy ambiance that made for the perfect dining setting.\n\nThe food was absolutely delicious\u2014starting with the fresh, crispy chips and flavorful salsa that had just the right amount of kick. I ordered the molcajete, and it was a showstopper! The sizzling mix of meats, vegetables, and rich, savory sauce was packed with bold flavors and served in a traditional stone bowl that kept everything hot and delicious.\n\nTo complement the meal, I had a sangria margarita, and it was the perfect balance of sweet, tangy, and refreshing. The service was attentive and friendly, making the whole experience even more enjoyable.\n\nIf you're looking for authentic Mexican flavors with great drinks and a welcoming atmosphere, this spot is definitely worth a visit!"

Broth is well-seasoned. Just wish they had more ramen selection or oils (black garlic oil please!) Hopefully they\u2019ll expand. Liked the katsu-don a lot.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a restaurant where I\u2019d bring a group of friends to socialize - definitely more of a \u201cI\u2019m craving a quick bite before work\u201d vibe. Very small joint next to the Poke place. However, for the convenience of not having to drive 15+ miles for ramen, the food\u2019s pretty good. I\u2019ve also gotten doordash delivery from them before and I appreciate the packaging."

The food was better 6 mo. - 1 yr. ago, but even then, it was really just the meats that made it worth the money.  The sides are all pretty disappointing...rubbery garlic bread, bland beans, slaw with no flavor and Mac and cheese that somehow manages to be too dry/chewy and too wet/mushy simultaneously. If the flavor was good, it might make up for this, but nope.\nWhen I arrived to pick up my order, I stood there for 5 minutes, but there were no other customers except one table getting ready to leave.\nI spent $75 to feed 2 people.\nMaybe I'll go back eventually to see if any improvements have been made, but probably not for a long time."

The facility used to be a Sizzlers Restaurant, and they had to close down because of the nasty COVID back in 2019. Reyna was our waitress, and she was excellent and professional and courteous in her service. The coffee was nice and hot. The Blue Berry waffle was yum yum! \u00a1\u00a1Muy Bueno!! The pancakes were also a hit with my lady. She enjoyed the fluffy and consistency in the batter made the pancakes proper for the belly and the palate. The facility was nice and big inside. A lot of room and they even had an extra room in the back section for private parties or meetings for any companies that wanted this restaurant as a company event. The place is in Morgan Hill California 18 miles south of San Jose and enjoyed finding something different in another town. They close at 2pm so they are open for breakfast and lunch. The food was EXCELLENT!!"

The Pad Thai was stuck together like glue and shaped as the to go container. The Pineapple Rice was horrible and super yellow I have never had pineapple fried rice like it. The \u201cCrab\u201dRangoon was mainly all cream cheese barely any imitation crab. For the $64 I spent it was not worth it, this place is more like fast food. Don\u2019t recommend it."

        "comment": "Siam Thai Restaurant in the Morgan Hill area offers a decent experience, though there are a few dishes that didn\u2019t quite impress.\n\nDrunken Noodles: The Drunken Noodles were pretty disappointing. The dish lacked the depth of flavor I was expecting and felt somewhat bland. The noodles were a bit too chewy, and the overall combination didn\u2019t live up to the hype. I wouldn\u2019t recommend this dish if you\u2019re looking for something flavorful.\n\nPanang Curry: On the other hand, the Panang Curry was much better. It had a decent flavor, and it paired really well with rice. The curry itself was rich and savory, with just the right amount of spice. If you\u2019re going to Siam Thai, I\u2019d definitely recommend ordering the curries over the noodles.\n\nService: The service was good. The staff were accommodating and attentive, making sure our needs were met throughout the meal. They were friendly and helped make the experience a bit more enjoyable.\n\nAmbience: The ambience was pleasant overall. The restaurant has a nice, comfortable vibe, and the outdoor patio area is particularly pleasing to the eyes. It\u2019s a relaxing spot to enjoy a meal, especially on a nice day when you can sit outside.\n\nOverall, Siam Thai Restaurant is a decent option in Morgan Hill, with the curries standing out as the highlight of the menu. The service and ambience are good, but some dishes, like the Drunken Noodles, could use some improvement."

It was a mistake that I didn't  notice untill recently and it was negative, It was not ment for this restaurant it was ment for China Palace another restaurant in town that has been in the community for a very long time that has gone downhill, but this is not about them.  So I want to apologize, and leave a review for this restaurant that it deserves.\nThis restaurant has been a staple in Morgan Hill for as long as I can remember. I have lived in morgan hill since nineteen eighty nine. Im a bit of an O.G. The food here is delicious and consistent. I had not been here in a few years but once I realized that I left the sense deleted negative review. I had to come and show my support, and it is just as I remember, wonderful. Wonderful food and wonderful service. My parents have been come here for there for their anniversarys for going on 35 years, partly   because it's tradition, but also because they serve a unique menu of Japanese inspired cuisine with an American twist.  My grandparents alos used to also frequent offend. So if you haven't tried moon's kitchen, or if you just haven't been in a while  you really should make a vist this weekend."

Excellent salsa and warm chips. Everyone ordered off the Happy Hour menu and the meal was extremely affordable- especially for the size of the portions! Enough for leftovers later. The drinks were tasty and enormous as well... and effective!\nOur waitress (and everyone else) was friendly and food and drinks came extremely fast. The decor is cool too- creative and unique. Lots of art everywhere- lots to look at while you're waiting if you're bored of the talk at your table (or if you're adhd like i am). I dig the living plants as well.\n\nGreat experience. \ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29\ud83e\udd29\n\nWe'll definitely be back!"

The restaurant was clean and the servers were nice-- what more can you ask for from a restaurant??\n\nWe ordered:\nEdamame- your standard salted edamame, a delightful snack for my kids\n\nToro on the rock- 10/10 recommend this! So fresh, melt in your mouth and it's topped with fresh wasabi. It's perfect!!\n\nJalape\u00f1o Hamachi- I love yellowtail, so this is a must for me\n\nKayla Roll- 10/10 the best role IMO.\n\nGoku roll- also very delicious with a nice crunch!\n\nShrimp tempura roll- for my sister who doesn't eat anything raw. She enjoyed this!\n\nHamachi Kama- so so sooooo good and meaty!! Nice sized portion!\n\nSpicy pork lunch plate- LOVED everything on the plate! It\u2019s perfect for those who don\u2019t eat raw. Perfect portion for me.\n\nSalmon belly nigiri- the BEST! Melts in your mouth and I love the fresh wasabi"

During the wait for the food I overheard them talking about my papusa as if they had run out of certain supplies it seemed and kept staring over at me and my partner I felt something had went wrong and considered going to ask if something was wrong but I trusted them but they failed to communicate with me the whole time .I ordered a papusa queso & chicharon when I got home I found there was absolutely no meat and the carne asada fries had extremely poor presentation , the avocado was very bruised with gray and black markings only 4 literal pieces of jalape\u00f1os. I had to drive all the way back to ask for a full refund and while already being very frustrated with the food the lady helping me made matters worse she greeted me with attitude and was very condescending, she kept rambling on to me about how I looked young and insisted that I listened to \u201cher advice \u201c  ive worked in customer service for 4  years now of course i deal with angry customers from time to time or deal with a refund and the way she handled it was very immature and unprofessional I only asked for a full refund because of how unappetizing the food was and paid 6$ for basically a quesadilla. She was very difficult trying to show me her unopened avacados to show me \u201chow fresh they were \u201c the interaction lasted almost 10 minutes because of how much she kept trying to lecture me overall very disappointed and unsatisfied with this place and visit , I was hoping to keep supporting this place but after the way I was treated today trust I will not be back and don\u2019t recommend to anyone unless you want to pay for overpriced unsatisfying unappetizing food . I wish I had taken a picture of the food to share but I\u2019ve seen similar reviews already saying they also had no meat in they\u2019re orders"

I was so impressed with their serving of food.\n\nThere is parking in the back.\n\nThe only thing I didn't like/ appreciate is that they gave my baby a lollipop without asking me for permission.\nOther than that, give this place a try."

Fish tacos were a little fishy to me and flakes of fish as opposed to a fried piece of fish. Asada tacos were the best part and they were just okay. Rice was not bad but the beans were tasteless.  Won't be back but you might like it because everyone's taste is different."

One of the items we ordered wasn't out of stock , Crystal called me to find out what we'd like as a substitute. The two ladies working were very kind and welcoming. The food was delicious ! We enjoyed the tamale pie, Birra tacos, and Thai coconut soup. All were made from very fresh ingredients and were tasty. We ordered our meal to go.  I asked her to include napkins and utensils,  and she gave us plenty. It was nice that she included the condiments for the soup and wrote on the outside of the bag where the condiments were to be used."

It looked nicer inside then when it was Yolked. The wife ordered the Popeye omelet. She said it was ok. I ordered the chocolate chip pancakes...it was a bit busier than I expected....a lot of stuff going on on top of them, so I didn't enjoy them as much as other chocolate chip pancakes I've had elsewhere. The son had chicken tenders and fries. The  chicken tenders didn't look very appetizing. Similar to what you would throw in the microwave and warm up. Our food choices weren't the best, but we'd go back to try other things. Ambiance and service was pretty good."

Heidi\u2019s exceptional service turned what I planned as a quick bite and beer into a much longer, thoroughly enjoyable afternoon. Her attention and hospitality made all the difference, and the food exceeded my expectations, perfectly complementing the inviting atmosphere. Whether you're stopping by for a casual drink or a full meal, this spot delivers on all fronts. I\u2019ll definitely be back for more!"

It's a perfect combo. 6oz steak with broccoli and mashed potaoes.potatoes. it also included my drink and a salad for like $16. It was very good and we also got chips and salsa (that I love). We sat at the bar and my buddy knew the bartender, that gave us great service ! We will be back."

The chicken was dry, but I give them the benefit of the doubt, it was slow, probably because of the rainy weather. If it was busier, the food might be fresher. The slaw and potato salad was good, and they had some fresh hot peppers and  delicious hot orange sauce in addition to the standard BBQ sauce. Surprisingly, the highlight for me was the garlic bread. It was very flavorful and perfectly soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. Delicious. I will be coming back."

The interior is incredibly unique and well-decorated, with a giant boxing ring set right in the center of the restaurant, which adds a really fun and cool vibe. It\u2019s a perfect spot for any sports fan, with pool tables, foosball, and TVs showing all the major games.\n\nI ordered the Warrior Burger with garlic fries, and they were absolutely delicious! The burger was cooked perfectly\u2014juicy and full of flavor, and the garlic fries had just the right amount of seasoning. Whether you\u2019re there to catch a game, enjoy a good meal, or hang out with friends over some pool, this place has it all. Highly recommend!"

Ambiance for our door seating was good, next to main Street, not too noisy but bustling with cars. Chai tea latte was great (a little on the sweeter side) and the turkey sandwich on sourdough hit the spot. The prices are also very competitive and economically friendly for proportion. Quick service too!"

The servers were attentive, ensuring I didn\u2019t need help deciphering menu items and ordering. We ended up getting the crab won tons, and I must mention that the crab is real, not imitation. Salt and pepper spareribs with little bits of hot peppers and green onion, giving it texture and spice. We also got the pot stickers and the seafood and beef noodle soup. Did I mention the dough is made fresh and that the potstickers and wontons are made by hand? I do not usually eat fried food, but everything was a hit. This is a new local go-to. Also, while we waited, the server brought us some snacks. I will be a repeat customer. I wish more businesses had this kind of customer service and quality food. I love this place!!!"

Unfortunately, the original owner retired, and the restaurant closed four years ago, leaving a hole in my heart for their amazing food.\n\nBut the good news is, I recently discovered that Taste of China had reopened a new location just 25 miles from my home! I couldn\u2019t believe it when I saw the familiar menu items listed on Google. When we arrived, I was beyond thrilled to find that the owner was there, and it felt like a reunion.\n\nNot only did we get to enjoy all the incredible dishes I\u2019ve missed for so long, but the owner, ever gracious and kind, treated us with extra dishes on the house, as a token of appreciation for being a loyal customer. The food was just as delicious as I remembered, and it\u2019s clear the passion for great cooking hasn\u2019t faded.\n\nThank you so much for bringing back these amazing flavors, and I wish you all the best with this new chapter. Welcome back, Taste of China \u2013 you've truly been missed!"

I let the cake sit out for about an hour to let the frosting get soft. This helps it stick to the cake . Be sure to slow down or you will drive right by it. It's a large white building right before the apartments. There's a large patio to enjoy the food."
